The inequality $c + h > a + b$ can be written as:\n\\[ \\frac{ab}{c} + c > a + b. \\]\nMultiplying both sides by $c$ (where $c > 0$), we obtain the equivalent inequality:\n\\[ c^2 - c(a+b) + ab > 0, \\]\nor\n\\[ (c - a)(c - b) > 0. \\]\nThis inequality is true because the hypotenuse is greater than each leg.\n\n$\\nabla$ In solving this problem, we established that if the products $ch$ and $ab$ of two pairs of positive numbers are equal, then the sum is greater for the pair whose numbers are more \"spread out\": if $a$ and $b$ are between $c$ and $h$, then $c + h > a + b$. This fact also follows from the fact that the function $f(x) = x + \\frac{A}{x}$ is monotonically increasing for $x \\geq A$.\n\n**Problem 4-2.** Answer: $c < 0$.\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. By condition, it does not cross zero, so its graph - a parabola - is either entirely above or entirely below the x-axis. \n\nNotice that $f(1) = a + b + c$; this number, by condition, is less than zero, which means the parabola is below the x-axis. Therefore $f(x) < 0$ for all values of $x$ and, in particular, $f(0) = c < 0$.\n\n∇ In the solution, we essentially used the continuity of the function $f$: if a function is continuous on an interval and does not become zero on it, then all its values on this interval have the same sign.\n\n**Problem 4-3.** Let's draw the axes of symmetry of the rectangle. They divide the given rectangle into 4 quarters. If the selected point lies in any of the two quarters containing points A and C, or on the boundary of these quarters, then the statement of the problem is obvious.\nLet the selected point lie inside one of the two remaining quarters. Reflect both cut lines with respect to the center of symmetry of the rectangle.\nFour lines (two cut lines and two symmetrical to them) divide the rectangle into 9 parts: four parts with area $S_1$, two parts with area $S_2$, two parts with area $S_3$, and one part with area $S_0$ (Fig. 46). We must prove that $S_1 + S_2$ or $S_1 + S_3$ does not exceed $\\frac{S}{4}$, where $S$ is the area of the entire rectangle.\n\n![Fig. 46](illustrations/fig46.png)\n\nSince\n$$4S_1 + 2S_2 + 2S_3 = S - S_0 < S,$$\nthen\n$$2S_1 + S_2 + S_3 < \\frac{S}{2}, \\text{ or } (S_1 + S_2) + (S_1 + S_3) < \\frac{S}{2}.$$\nThis means that one of the numbers $S_1 + S_2$, $S_1 + S_3$ is less than $\\frac{S}{4}$ (if both were not less than $\\frac{S}{4}$, then their sum would be not less than $\\frac{S}{2}$).\n\n∇ The following stereometric problem, similar to problem 4-3, is of interest: let $V_1 \\leq V_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq V_8$ be the volumes of the eight parts into which a parallelepiped of volume 1 is divided by three planes passing through its point and parallel to its faces; within what limits can each of the values $V_i$, $i = 1, 2, \\dots, 8$ vary? For example, it turns out that $0 \\leq V_4 \\leq \\frac{1}{8}$ and for any $V_4$ from this interval, there is a corresponding partition of the parallelepiped. (When proving the inequality $V_4 \\leq \\frac{1}{8}$, it is convenient to use the fact that two opposite parts have volumes whose products are not greater than $\\frac{1}{64}$.) A similar question can be considered for an $n$-dimensional parallelepiped of unit volume.\n\n**Problem 4-4.** Answer: if the bank accrues interest once a month. \nLet the interest be accrued once a year. Then at the end of the first year, the deposit will be equal to\n$$\\left(1000 + 1000 \\cdot \\frac{5}{100} \\right) = 1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right) \\text{ rubles}.$$\nAt the end of the second year, the deposit will increase by 5% from this amount and will become equal to\n$$1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right) = 1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right)^2 \\text{ rubles}.$$\nReasoning similarly, we see that after 10 years the depositor will receive\n$$1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right)^{10} \\text{ rubles}.$$\nIf interest is accrued once a month, then in the same way we find that the depositor will receive after 10 years (i.e., after 120 months)\n$$1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{1200} \\right)^{120} \\text{ rubles}.$$\nWe will show that the second number is greater than the first. To do this, it is enough to show that\n$$\\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right) < \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{1200} \\right)^{12}.$$\nLet's start calculating the right side of this inequality – the product of twelve identical expressions\n$$\\left(1 + \\frac{5}{1200} \\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{1200} \\right) \\dots \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{1200} \\right).$$\nIn the process of multiplication, we will have to take 1 in each bracket and multiply them all – we get 1 as a result. If we take $\\frac{5}{1200}$ in one bracket and 1 in the others, then we get $\\frac{5}{1200}$; but there are as many such products as there are brackets, i.e. 12, and they give the number $12 \\cdot \\frac{5}{1200} = \\frac{5}{100}$. Although we have not taken into account all the terms, we already got $1 + \\frac{5}{100}$, so the entire product will be greater than this number.\n\n∇ Let K rubles be deposited in the bank and the bank pays p% per annum. Reasoning in the same way as in the solution to problem 4-4, we will see that after m years the depositor will receive $K \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100} \\right)^m$ rubles (the so-called compound interest formula).\nThis value can be roughly estimated from below using Bernoulli's inequality, which we have essentially already proved:\n$$\\left(1 + x \\right)^n > 1 + nx \\text{ for } x > 0, n > 1.$$\n(In the solution to problem 4-4, it was $x = \\frac{5}{1200}$, $n = 12$.)\nIt follows from this inequality that if we reduce the payment periods and proportionally reduce the interest rate, then the depositor will receive a larger amount. This is due to the fact that for $a > 0$ the sequence\n$$x = \\left(1 + \\frac{a}{n} \\right)^n$$\nis increasing. However, it turns out that the depositor will not be able to get too much benefit from reducing the terms, since this sequence is bounded. Its limit is the number $e^a$. If you calculate the sums from problem 4-4 on a calculator, then in the first case we get about 1629 rubles, in the second – about 1647 rubles, and $1000e^{0.05} \\approx 1649$.\n\nLet there be $k$ overcrowded and $l$ non-overcrowded buses in the column. Denote the number of passengers traveling in overcrowded buses by $A$, and the number of the rest by $B$.\nThen $A > 50k$, $B \\leq 50l$, and therefore $\\frac{A}{k} > 50$, $\\frac{B}{l} \\leq 50$. Thus, $\\frac{A}{k} > \\frac{B}{l}$. From the last inequality, the following follows:\n$$\\frac{B}{A} < \\frac{l}{k},$$\n$$\\frac{A + B}{A} < \\frac{l + k}{k},$$\n$$\\frac{A}{A + B} > \\frac{k}{l + k},$$\nfrom where\n$$\\frac{A}{A + B} \\cdot 100\\% > \\frac{k}{l + k} \\cdot 100\\%.$$\nIn the last inequality, on the left is the percentage of people traveling in overcrowded buses, and on the right is the percentage of overcrowded buses.\n\n**Problem 4-6.** Answer: a) 7; b) 16.\nLet there be $n$ participants in the circle, of which $m$ are girls. We need to find the smallest natural number $n$ for which there exists such a natural number $m$ that\n$$\\frac{2}{5} < \\frac{m}{n} < \\frac{1}{2}.$$\nIterating through the values of $n$ from 2 to 7, we find that only the fraction $\\frac{3}{7}$ with denominator 7 satisfies this inequality. Thus, 7 is the smallest possible value of $n$.\n\n∇ Note that the fraction $\\frac{3}{7}$ is obtained from the fractions $\\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ as follows: its numerator is the sum of their numerators, and the denominator is the sum of their denominators.\n\nFor any positive fractions $\\frac{a}{b}$ and $\\frac{c}{d}$ ($\\frac{a}{b} < \\frac{c}{d}$), the fraction $\\frac{a+c}{b+d}$ satisfies the inequalities $\\frac{a}{b} < \\frac{a+c}{b+d} < \\frac{c}{d}$ and is called the mediant of these fractions.\n\nWriting out irreducible fractions with a denominator not exceeding $n$ in ascending order, we get the following table:\n![](illustrations/p78.png)\nEach $n$-th row (Farey sequence) is obtained from the $(n-1)$-th row according to the following rule: in the $(n-1)$-th row, one needs to mark all such pairs of neighboring fractions $\\frac{a}{b}$, $\\frac{c}{d}$, for which the sum of the denominators is equal to $n$, and insert their mediants – fractions $\\frac{a+c}{b+d}$ (they are always irreducible) between them.\n\nIn problem a), we found the row number $n=7$, in which the fraction located between the fractions $\\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ first appears.\n\nIn problem b), acting by brute force is quite tedious. Let's proceed as follows. We must find a solution to the inequalities\n$$\n\\frac{43}{100} < \\frac{m}{n} < \\frac{44}{100} = \\frac{11}{25}\n$$\nwith the smallest natural $n$.\n\nLet's invert all the fractions and subtract their common integer part:\n$$\n\\frac{n}{43} - 2 > \\frac{m}{11} > \\frac{25}{11} - 2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{n-86}{43} > \\frac{m}{11} > \\frac{3}{11}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{11(n-86)}{43} > m > 3\n$$\nLet's do the same thing again:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{m-3(n-2m)} = \\frac{1}{7m-3n} \\le \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nand one more time:\n$$\n\\frac{14}{n-2m} > \\frac{3}{7m-3n} > 2\n$$\nNotice that here, for the first time, integers appear between the bounds of the inequality. The smallest of them is the number 2. The system of equations $n-2m=2$, $7m-3n=1$ has a solution in natural numbers $n=16$, $m=7$.\n\nLet's prove that this is the solution to the problem. From inequalities (2)–(4) it follows that\n$$\nn-2m > 0, \\quad 7m-3n \\ge 1, \\quad n-2m \\ge 2\n$$\nTherefore\n$$\nn = 7(n-2m) + 2(7m-3n) \\ge 7 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 16\n$$\n∇ Analyzing this solution, we notice that, in essence, we are expanding the numbers $\\frac{43}{100}$ and $\\frac{11}{25}$ into continued fractions:\n$$\n\\frac{43}{100} = \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{14}{43}} = \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac{1}{14}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{11}{25} = \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{3}{11}} = \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac{2}{3}}}\n$$\nThen we take the common part of these expansions at the step where the expansions differ, between $\\frac{1}{14}$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$ we insert the smallest integer, i.e. 1, and as a result we get the answer:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{3+1}} = \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{16}{36}\n$$\nThis algorithm allows you to quickly find a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$ with the smallest denominator $n$ in any given interval $0 < \\alpha < \\frac{m}{n} < \\beta$ (see [61, 119]).\n\nProblem 4-7. Answer: The maximum distance is 620454/11 km. Tires need to be changed so that each of them is front for one third of the way.\n\nLet's take as a unit the amount of rubber that can be worn out on one tire before it becomes unusable. Then, before the trip, there are 6 units of rubber in total. From the condition, it follows that for 1 km of the path, 1/15000 units are erased if the tire is in front, and 1/25000 if it is in the back. This means that for 1 km of the path, 2/15000 + 4/25000 = 11/37500 units of rubber are erased. Let the car have travelled x km. Then 11x/37500 units of rubber have been erased. Since no more than 6 units can be erased, we have \n$$\n\\frac{11x}{37500} \\le 6\n$$\nfrom where \n$$\nx \\le \\frac{20454}{11} \\times 6\n$$\nTo drive all 20454/11 km, it is necessary to change the tires so that each of them is in front for a third of this distance: then they will all wear out simultaneously - by the end of the journey.\n\nProblem 4-8. Answer: 12 minutes.\n\nIt is quite clear that if the Kid and Carlson want to eat breakfast in the shortest possible time, then they must start and finish eating at the same time - otherwise, one of them can help the other and reduce the time spent.\n\nLet us denote by x, y, z the shares of cake, jam and milk that the Kid ate; then (1-x), (1-y), (1-z) are the shares of these products that Carlson ate, and the time they spent is equal to\n$$\nt = 10x + 13y + 14z = 6(1-x) + 6(1-y) + 7(1-z)\n$$\nThus, we come to the following problem: find the minimum value of the quantity t = 10x + 13y + 14z, if the numbers x, y, z satisfy the conditions 0≤x≤1, 0≤y≤1, 0≤z≤1 and\n$$\n10x + 13y + 14z = 6(1-x) + 6(1-y) + 7(1-z)\n$$\nFrom the last relation, one can express z in terms of x and y:\n$$\nz = \\frac{1}{21}(19 - 16x - 19y)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression into the formula for t, we get\n$$\nt = -\\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{1}{3}y + \\frac{38}{3}\n$$\nFrom this formula, we see that $t$ will be smaller the larger $x$ is and the smaller $y$ is. Let's take the largest possible value of $x$ and the smallest possible value of $y$: $x=1, y=0$. In this case, $t=12$ minutes, and $z$ is within the permissible limits. Consequently, the minimum value of $t$ is achieved in the case when the Kid eats the cake and drinks the milk, and Carlson eats all the jam and drinks the milk.\n\n$\\nabla$ We have reduced problem 4-8 to a linear programming problem: find the minimum of a linear function under the condition that the variables are non-negative and satisfy a system of linear inequalities and equations.\n\nIf it were required to solve a similar problem for $n > 3$ products, then such a solution method would lead to rather cumbersome calculations; however, it is possible to specify a simple general rule that indicates the optimal plan for the distribution of products.\n\nLet $a_i$ be the time it takes for the Kid to eat the $i$-th product, and $b_i$ be the time it takes for Carlson to eat it; we will assume that the products are numbered in ascending order of the ratios of these times:\n$$\\frac{a_1}{b_1} \\le \\frac{a_2}{b_2} \\le ... \\le \\frac{a_n}{b_n}. \\quad (1)$$\nThe plan, in which the breakfast time will be the smallest, is as follows: the Kid starts with the first product and eats them further in the order of numbers, and Carlson starts simultaneously with him from the last product and eats them in reverse order.\n\nIn our problem, three products should be ordered as follows: the first is the cake, the second is the milk, the third is the jam. The ratios of times will then satisfy the inequalities\n$$\\frac{10}{6} \\le \\frac{4}{7} \\le \\frac{13}{6}.$$\nIn the first 6 minutes, Carlson eats the jam, and the Kid eats part of the cake. In the next 4 minutes, the Kid finishes the cake, and Carlson drinks $\\frac{4}{7}$ of the milk. And finally, in the last 2 minutes, they both finish the milk.\n\nTo prove the optimality of the proposed plan, it is convenient to introduce a conditional measure for each product. We will consider the nutritional value of the $i$-th product to be equal to $(a_i + b_i)$ calories, then the eating rate (calories per unit of time) when eating the $i$-th product for the Kid is equal to $\\frac{a_i+b_i}{a_i} = 1 + \\frac{b_i}{a_i}$, and for Carlson $\\frac{a_i+b_i}{b_i} = 1 + \\frac{a_i}{b_i}$. We see that the Kid's speed is greater the smaller $\\frac{a_i}{b_i}$ is, and Carlson's speed is the opposite. Thus, in order to get as many calories as possible in time $t$, the Kid should eat the products in the order of numbers, and Carlson in the reverse order. Let the Kid and Carlson get all $(a_1 + b_1) + ... + (a_n + b_n)$ calories in some time $t$ according to our plan. Then, with any other plan, in the same time $t$, they will receive fewer calories, which means they will not be able to eat all the products.\n\nYou can specify a graphical procedure that gives the answer. Let's draw in the second quarter of the coordinate plane $Oxy$ a broken line whose links are vectors with coordinates $(b_1, a_1), (b_2, a_2), ..., (b_n, a_n)$, going in such an order that inequalities (1) are satisfied; the beginning $M$ of this broken line lies on the $Ox$ axis, the end $K$ on the $Oy$ axis (Fig. 47 corresponds to the case $n = 3$; in problem 4-8, the three vectors that make up the broken line have coordinates $(6, 10), (7, 14)$, and $(6, 13)$). \n\n![Fig. 47](illustrations/fig47.png)\n\nLet's mark the point $L$ of intersection of this broken line with the bisector $x + y = 0$ of the second coordinate quarter. The ordinate $t$ of the point $L$ indicates the desired minimal time, and the part $ML$ of the broken line indicates the products that Malysh eats, and the part $LK$ indicates the products that Karlsson eats.\n\n**Problem 4-9.** Answer: 10 or 11 trains.\n\nLet the trains depart with an interval of $T$ minutes. Since in 12 minutes 4 full intervals have definitely passed, $4T \\le 12$, i.e., $T \\le 3$. Since no more than $T$ minutes have passed before the departure of the first of the 5 trains and after the departure of the last of them, $T + 4T + T > 12$, i.e., $T > 2$. So, $2 < T \\le 3$.\n\nSimilarly, from the fact that exactly 6 trains departed in 20 minutes, we get $\\frac{20}{7} < T \\le 4$. From these inequalities it follows that $2 < T \\le 3$.\n\nLet $n$ trains depart in 30 minutes. Then, similarly, we get $(n-1)T \\le 30 < (n+1)T$ or $\\frac{30}{T} - 1 < n \\le \\frac{30}{T} + 1$.\n\nTaking into account that $2 < T \\le 3$, we find that $9 < n \\le 11$, i.e., $n = 10$ or $n = 11$.\n\nIf $T = 3$ and the first train departs immediately upon Vitya's arrival, then 11 trains will depart in 30 minutes, and if with the same $T$ the first train departs 1 minute after his arrival, then 10 trains will depart in 30 minutes, i.e., both answer options are realized.\n\n$\\nabla$ The solution to this problem is related to the following general question. Let points be placed on a straight line at equal distances $T$ from each other. What is the number $n$ of these points that a segment of length $b$ can contain?\n\nAnswer: $\\frac{b}{T} - 1 < n \\le \\frac{b}{T} + 1$.\n\n**Problem 4-10.** Answer: 5 three-ton trucks.\n\nLet's first show that 4 three-ton trucks may not be enough. Let's take 13 identical boxes weighing $\\frac{10}{13}$ tons each. Then we cannot put more than three boxes in one three-ton truck, and no more than 12 boxes in four trucks.\n\nNow let's prove that 5 three-ton trucks are always enough. Indeed, we can load at least two tons of cargo into each three-ton truck (if less than two tons are loaded, we can add another box). Then at least 10 tons can be loaded into 5 three-ton trucks.\n\n$\\nabla$ A more general problem. Several boxes weigh a total of $T$ tons, and each of them weighs no more than 1 ton. What is the minimum number of $p$-ton trucks ($p > 1$) that is definitely enough to carry all this cargo at once?\n\nLet $\\gamma = \\frac{p}{[p] + 1}$, where $[p]$ is the integer part of the number $p$. Then the answer is the smallest integer $N$ greater than or equal to $\\frac{T - \\gamma}{p - \\gamma}$.\n\nIn the example showing that a smaller number of trucks may not be enough, it is necessary to take all the loads equal (and slightly larger than $\\gamma$). You can load $N$ trucks in descending order of their masses. For the proof, it is convenient to use the following lemma: if there are several boxes with a total mass of more than $p$ tons (each is no more than 1), then you can load more than $p - \\gamma$ tons onto a $p$-ton truck. In problem 4-10, $p = 3$, $T = 10$, $\\gamma = \\frac{3}{4}$; it follows from the lemma that more than $\\frac{9}{4}$ tons can be loaded onto one three-ton truck, and the weight of the cargo, 10 tons, as we know, can be transported on 5 three-ton trucks; this is exactly the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\frac{T - \\gamma}{p - \\gamma} = \\frac{37}{9}$.\n\nFor experts. It is interesting to compare this problem with the \"stone problem\" often encountered in applications. There are several stones with known masses $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and a $p$-ton truck ($p, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ are natural numbers). The question is whether it is possible to select several of these stones so as to completely load the $p$-ton truck with them. In other words, are there such numbers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, equal to 0 or 1, that the equality $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = p$ is satisfied?\n\nThe latter problem belongs to the class of so-called universal enumeration problems. There is no known algorithm for solving them that works significantly faster than brute-force enumeration of all options. (Unlike this problem, loading boxes, which was discussed in the generalization of problem 4-10, can be done very quickly; see [97].)\n\n**Problem 4-11. Answer: either all three numbers are equal to zero, or one of them is equal to zero, and the other two are ones.**\n\nNote that all three numbers are non-negative, since each of them is a square. Let's denote them in descending order as follows:\n$$x \\ge y \\ge z \\ge 0.$$\nThen $x - z \\ge y - z \\ge 0$, whence $(x - z)^2 \\ge (y - z)^2$. But $(x - z)^2 = y$, and $(y - z)^2 = x$. So, on the one hand, $x \\ge y$, on the other hand, $y \\ge x$, and thus $x = y$. In this case, we get $z = 0$ and $x = x^2$, i.e., $x = 0$ or $x = 1$.\n\n$\\nabla$ Inequalities were not involved in the condition of this problem, but they appeared in the solution. The idea of ordering equal unknowns helps in many other situations as well.\n\n**Problem 4-12.** Note that $m$ and $n$ enter symmetrically into the condition of the problem, so we can assume that $m \\ge n \\ge 2$. In this case, $m^n \\le n^n$. Thus, it is sufficient to prove the inequality $n^n \\le 3^3$ or\n$$n^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}.$$ (1)\nIf $n = 2$, the inequality $2^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ is true, since when both sides are raised to the sixth power, we get $8 < 9$. Now let's take the natural logarithm of both sides of inequality (1) and prove that $\\frac{\\ln n}{n} \\le \\frac{\\ln 3}{3}$ for $n \\ge 3$.\n\nThe derivative of the function $\\frac{\\ln x}{x}$ is negative for $x \\ge 3$: \n$$\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{x}\\right)' = \\frac{(1 - \\ln x)}{x^2} < 0,$$\nsince $\\ln x > 1$ for $x \\ge 3 > e$.\n\nHence it follows that the function $\\frac{\\ln x}{x}$ is decreasing for $x \\ge 3$ and, consequently, $\\frac{\\ln x}{x} \\le \\frac{\\ln 3}{3}$ for $x \\ge 3$.\n\n$\\nabla$ The inequality $n^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ for natural $n \\ge 3$ can also be proved by induction; if it is true for some $n = k$, then it is also true for the next $n = k + 1$: the inequality $(k + 1)^{\\frac{1}{k+1}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ is obtained from $k^{\\frac{1}{k}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ by multiplying term by term by the true (for $k \\ge 3$) inequality $\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\n**Problem 4-13.** Answer: the smallest value is reached at $n = 10^{10} - 1$ and at $n = 10^{10}$. Let $a_n = \\frac{\\lg 2 \\cdot \\lg 3 \\cdot ... \\cdot \\lg n}{n}$. Note that $a_n = \\left(\\frac{\\lg n}{10}\\right)^{a_n}$.\n\nIf $\\lg n < 10$, then $a_n < a_{n-1}$; if $\\lg n = 10$, then $a_n = a_{n-1}$; if $\\lg n > 10$, then $a_n > a_{n-1}$. Thus, the sequence $(a_n)$ decreases up to $n = 10^{10} - 1$, then has two equal terms with numbers $10^{10} - 1$ and $10^{10}$, and starting from the next number, the sequence increases.\n\n**Problem 4-14.** Answer: The maximum value is 1/4.\n\nThis value is achieved, for example, when $x_1 = x_2 = 1/2$ and $x_3 = x_4 = x_5 = 0$.\n\nLet's show that $x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_3x_4 + x_4x_5 \\leq 1/4$ for all non-negative values of $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$. Indeed,\n\n$x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_3x_4 + x_4x_5 \\leq (x_1 + x_3 + x_5)(x_2 + x_4)$,\n\nbecause if we expand the brackets on the right side, we get all the terms on the left side, plus several non-negative terms.\n\nNow it's sufficient to apply the inequality between geometric and arithmetic means to two numbers, $u = x_1 + x_3 + x_5 \\geq 0$ and $v = x_2 + x_4 \\geq 0$, which sum to one:\n\n$uv \\leq (\\frac{u+v}{2})^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThus,\n\n$(x_1 + x_3 + x_5)(x_2 + x_4) = uv \\leq \\frac{(u+v)^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n$\\nabla$ Similarly, it can be proved that for any $n$ non-negative numbers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ that add up to 1, the largest value of the quantity $x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + ... + x_{n-1}x_n$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n**Problem 4-15.** To prove, we compare the left and right sides of the inequality given in the condition with the expression $a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2$: we will prove that\n$$a^4 + b^4 + c^4 \\ge a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2 \\ge a^2bc + b^2ac + c^2ab.$$\nAdding term by term three valid inequalities $a^4 + b^4 - 2a^2b^2 \\ge 0$, $b^4 + c^4 - 2b^2c^2 \\ge 0$, $c^4 + a^4 - 2a^2c^2 \\ge 0$, we get $2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) \\ge 2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2)$.\nAdding term by term three valid inequalities $a^2(b^2 + c^2 - 2bc) \\ge 0$, $b^2(a^2 + c^2 - 2ac) \\ge 0$, $c^2(b^2 + a^2 - 2ba) \\ge 0$, we get\n$$2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2) \\ge 2(a^2bc + b^2ac + c^2ab).$$\n\n$\\nabla$ The following general Muirhead's theorem is related to the inequality from problem 4-15. Let a monomial $x_1^{\\alpha_1}x_2^{\\alpha_2}...x_n^{\\alpha_n}$ of $n$ variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ be given. Let's call its symmetrization the polynomial $\\Phi_{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_n}$, equal to the arithmetic mean of all possible monomials obtained from the given one by permutation of variables; for example,\n$$\\Phi_{2, 2, 0}(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{3}(x^2y^2 + y^2z^2 + z^2x^2).$$\nConsider two sets $\\alpha = (\\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_n)$ and $\\beta = (\\beta_1, ..., \\beta_n)$ of exponents $\\alpha_1 \\ge \\alpha_2 \\ge ... \\ge \\alpha_n \\ge 0$ and $\\beta_1 \\ge \\beta_2 \\ge ... \\ge \\beta_n \\ge 0$.\n\nFor the inequality\n$$\\Phi_{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_n} \\ge \\Phi_{\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n}$$\nto hold for all non-negative values of $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, it is necessary and sufficient that the set $\\alpha$ majorizes the set $\\beta$ in the following sense:\n$$\\alpha_1 \\ge \\beta_1,$$\n$$\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 \\ge \\beta_1 + \\beta_2,$$\n$$...................................................$$\n$$\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + ... + \\alpha_{n-1} \\ge \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + ... + \\beta_{n-1},$$\n$$\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + ... + \\alpha_n \\ge \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + ... + \\beta_n.$$\nThis system of conditions is briefly written as:\n$$(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_n) \\succ (\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n).$$\n\n![Fig. 48](illustrations/fig48.png)\n\nIt has the following visual interpretation: if the sets of exponents are depicted as stairs, in which the width of the steps is equal to 1, and the height is the numbers of the set, then the second set should be obtained from the first by cutting off pieces of steps and throwing them down to the right (to one of the following steps). In problem 4-15 (Fig. 48), (2, 2, 0) is obtained from the set (4, 0, 0), and (2, 1, 1) is obtained from it:\n$$(4, 0, 0) \\succ (2, 2, 0) \\succ (2, 1, 1).$$\nThe operation of \"throwing steps\" suggests a way to prove any of the inequalities referred to in Muirhead's theorem (see [102]).\n\nFigures of several cells that have the shape of stairs turn out to be convenient in many other combinatorial and algebraic problems (see problem 6-10).\n\n**Problem 4-16.** To get rid of the radicals, let $x = b^{\\frac{1}{15}}$, $y = a^{\\frac{1}{10}}$. Then the given inequality will take the form\n$$3x^5 + 2y^5 - 5x^3y^2 \\ge 0.$$\nDividing both sides of the inequality by $y^5$ and denoting $\\frac{x}{y}$ by $t$, we get the equivalent inequality\n$$3t^5 - 5t^3 + 2 \\ge 0.$$\nThe left side is factored:\n$$(t-1)^2(3t^3 + 6t^2 + 4t + 2) \\ge 0.$$\nFor $t > 0$, both factors are non-negative, so the inequality is true. It turns into equality only for $t = 1$, i.e., for $a = b$.\n\n$\\nabla$ You can prove the original inequality using the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean for five numbers:\n$$\\frac{1}{5}(3\\sqrt[15]{b} + 3\\sqrt[15]{b} + 3\\sqrt[15]{b} + 2\\sqrt[10]{a} + 2\\sqrt[10]{a})^5 \\ge 5(3\\sqrt[15]{b})^3 \\cdot (2\\sqrt[10]{a})^2 = 108 \\sqrt[5]{ab}.$$\n\nSimilarly, it can be proved that for any $k$ positive numbers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_k$ and natural numbers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_k$ with the sum $p_1 + ... + p_k = p$,\n$$\\frac{p_1 a_1^{p_1} + p_2 a_2^{p_2} + ... + p_k a_k^{p_k}}{p} \\ge (a_1 a_2 ... a_k)^{\\frac{p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_k}{p}}.$$\nAnd here is another proof (leading to a different generalization).\n\nPutting $a = y^{\\frac{5}{3}}$, $b = x^{\\frac{5}{2}}$, we reduce the original inequality to the form\n$$3x^{\\frac{5}{2}} + 2y^{\\frac{5}{3}} \\ge 5xy.$$\nThis is a special case of Young's inequality: for any positive $x, y, \\alpha, \\beta$, where $\\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{\\beta} = 1$,\n$$\\frac{x^\\alpha}{\\alpha} + \\frac{y^\\beta}{\\beta} \\ge xy.$$\nThis, in turn, is a special case of the inequality $f(x) + g(y) \\ge xy$, (*)\nwhere $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions defined for all non-negative values of the argument, for which $f'$ and $g'$ are mutually inverse monotonically increasing functions, and\n$$f(0) = g(0) = f'(0) = g'(0) = 0$$\n(the functions $f$ and $g$ are called dual according to Young).\n\nNote that for each value of $y$ there is exactly one value of $x$ for which the inequality (*) turns into an equality; for these values $y = f'(x)$ and $x = g'(y)$. Therefore, the function $g$ can be defined through the function $f$ as follows: for each $k$,\n$$g(k) = \\max_x (kx - f(x)).$$\nSuch a transition from the function $f$ to the function $g$ is called the Legendre transform of the function $f$. In this case, the function $f$ will, in turn, be the Legendre transform of the function $g$ – see Figure 49 (see [79]).\n\n![Fig. 49](illustrations/fig49.png)\n\n**Problem 4-17.** Let's draw three diagonals $AD, BE$, and $CF$ of the hexagon $ABCDEF$, connecting each vertex to the opposite one. Let them intersect at the points $K, L, M$ – see Figure 50, a; in the special case, the points $K, L$, and $M$ may coincide. \n\n![Fig. 50](illustrations/fig50.png)\n\nConsider six triangles, which together with the triangle $KLM$ make up the hexagon $ABCDEF$ – in our figure, these are triangles $ABL, BCL, CDM, DEM, EFK, FAK$ (Fig. 50, b). The area of at least one of them is not greater than $\\frac{S}{6}$, where $S$ is the area of the hexagon (otherwise, the sum of these six areas would be greater than $S$, which is impossible). Let, for example, $S_{ABL} \\le \\frac{S}{6}$ (Fig. 50, c). We claim that then the area of one of the triangles $ABC$ and $ABF$ with the same base $AB$ is not greater than $\\frac{S}{6}$. Indeed, the area of a triangle with base $AB$ and height $h$ is equal to $\\frac{AB \\cdot h}{2}$, and the height of triangle $ABL$ is enclosed between the heights of triangles $ABC$ and $ABF$, i.e., it is not greater than one of them.\n\n$\\nabla$ In the last reasoning, one can single out a frequently encountered consideration: the largest value of a linear function $f(x)$ defined on some interval $[a; b]$ is always reached at one of the ends of the interval, i.e., for any $x$, the value of $f(x)$ does not exceed $f(a)$ or $f(b)$. In our problem, such a function was the area of the triangle $f(h) = \\frac{AB \\cdot h}{2}$.\n\n**Problem 4-18.** Let $\\alpha \\le \\beta \\le \\gamma$. Considering $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as fixed, let's consider the derivative with respect to $\\gamma$ of the difference between the right and left sides. It is equal to\n$$\\left(3 \\sin \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma}{3} - \\sin \\alpha - \\sin \\beta - \\sin \\gamma \\right)' = \\cos \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma}{3} - \\cos \\gamma \\ge 0,$$\nsince $0 \\le \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma}{3} \\le \\gamma \\le \\pi$ and for $t \\in [0; \\pi]$ the function $y = \\cos t$ is decreasing (the derivatives of the constants $\\sin \\alpha$ and $\\sin \\beta$ are equal to 0). If we prove the validity of our inequality for $\\gamma = \\beta$, then it will also be valid for $\\gamma \\ge \\beta$ – with the growth of $\\gamma$, the difference between the right and left sides of the inequality will increase. So, it remains to prove that for all $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, $\\alpha \\le \\beta$,\n$$\\sin \\alpha + 2 \\sin \\beta \\le 3 \\sin \\frac{\\alpha + 2\\beta}{3}.$$\n\nLet's repeat the same reasoning. The derivative with respect to $\\beta$ of the difference between the right and left sides is equal to\n$$2 \\cos \\frac{\\alpha + 2\\beta}{3} - 2 \\cos \\beta \\ge 0,$$\nsince $0 \\le \\frac{\\alpha + 2\\beta}{3} \\le \\beta \\le \\pi$. But for $\\beta = \\alpha$, the inequality turns into an equality. Therefore, it is true for $\\beta \\ge \\alpha$.\n\n$\\nabla$ Taking $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = \\pi$ or $\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 2\\pi$ in the condition of the problem, we get inequalities equivalent to the fact that the perimeter and area of any triangle are not greater than those of a regular triangle with the same radius of the circumscribed circle.\n\nThe method by which this problem is solved allows us to prove the following general theorem. Let a function $f(x)$ be defined on the interval $[a; b]$, whose derivative $f'(x)$ does not increase (such a function is called convex upward). Then for any $n$ points $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ on this interval and for any $n$ positive numbers $p_1, p_2, ..., p_n$ with the sum $p_1 + ... + p_n = 1$, the following Jensen's inequality holds:\n$$f(p_1x_1 + ... + p_nx_n) \\ge p_1f(x_1) + ... + p_nf(x_n).$$\nIn our problem, $f(x) = \\sin x$, $x \\in [0; \\pi]$, and $p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nIf we take the function $f(x) = \\ln x$ and $p_1 = p_2 = ... = p_n = \\frac{1}{n}$, then we get the inequality\n$$\\frac{x_1 + ... + x_n}{n} \\ge \\sqrt[n]{x_1 ... x_n},$$\nor\n$$\\ln \\frac{x_1 + ... + x_n}{n} \\ge \\frac{\\ln x_1 + ... + \\ln x_n}{n} \\ge \\ln \\sqrt[n]{x_1 ... x_n},$$\n– the classical inequality between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean of $n$ numbers ($x_1 > 0, ..., x_n > 0$).\n\nFor the function $f(x) = -x^2$, we get the inequality\n$$(p_1x_1 + ... + p_nx_n)^2 \\le p_1x_1^2 + ... + p_nx_n^2;$$\nand from it, putting $x_k = a_kb_k$, $p_k = \\frac{b_k^2}{(b_1^2 + ... + b_n^2)}$, we can derive the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky inequality:\n$$(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \\le (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2),$$\naccording to which the scalar product of two vectors is not greater than the product of their lengths (in our proof it was important that all $b_k$ are different from zero, but the last inequality is obviously true without this assumption) – see [80].\n\n\n**Problem 4-19.** Answer: $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}$. (This area has a trapezoid, in which the lateral sides and one of the bases are equal to 1, and the other is 2.)\n\n![Fig. 51](illustrations/fig51.png)\n\nLet in the quadrilateral $ABCD$ (which, obviously, can be considered convex) $AB = BC = CD = 1$ and $K$ is the midpoint of the side $AD$ – see Figure 51. Completing the broken line $ABCD$ symmetrically with respect to the point $K$ with a three-link broken line $DB'C'A$, we get a centrally symmetric hexagon, all sides of which are equal to 1. It can be divided into three rhombuses $ABCO, CDB'O, B'C'AO$, and its area is equal to $\\sin \\alpha + \\sin \\beta + \\sin \\gamma$, where $\\alpha, \\beta$, and $\\gamma$ are the angles between the segments $OA, OC$, and $OB'$, which add up to $2\\pi$. According to the previous problem, this area is not greater than $3 \\sin \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, and equality is possible when $\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, i.e., when the constructed hexagon is regular.\n\n$\\nabla$ It can be proved that the largest in area among all $n$-gons with given lengths $a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}$ of consecutive sides (except for one, $AZ$) will be the one whose vertices all lie on a semicircle with diameter $AZ$. This is a variant of the \"Dido problem\" about what is the largest area adjacent to a given line that can be enclosed by a line of a given length with ends on this line (such a line will be a semicircle).\n\nIf all the lengths of the sides of the $n$-gon are known, then the largest in area will be (the only one – if the order of the sides is fixed) inscribed in a circle. Accordingly, the largest area among all figures of a given perimeter is possessed by a circle (isoperimetric theorem, see [35]).\n\nFigure 51\n\n**Problem 4-20. Answer: $\\frac{3}{2}$.**\n\nA convex polyhedron with 5 vertices cannot be anything other than the union of two tetrahedra (triangular pyramids) with a common base (Fig. 52). Indeed, it has such a vertex from which 4 edges emerge to all other vertices (if only 3 edges emerged from each vertex, then there would be a total of $5 \\cdot 3 = 15$ ends of the edges, but each edge has two ends, so there would be $\\frac{15}{2}$ edges, which is impossible). Let these vertices be $A, B, C, D$, and let the edges emerge from vertex $E$ to them. Then the polyhedron is the union of two tetrahedra $EABC$ and $EBCD$ with a common face $EBC$.\n\nLet $S_{ABC}$ be the area of triangle $ABC$, and $h_E$ and $h_D$ be the heights of the tetrahedra $EABC$ and $DABC$ dropped from vertices $E$ and $D$ onto the plane $ABC$. Then the sum of the volumes of these tetrahedra is equal to\n$$\\frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} h_E + \\frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} h_D = \\frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} (h_E + h_D).$$\nSimilarly, if we consider the tetrahedra $EABD$ and $ECBD$ with a common face $EBD$, then the sum of their volumes is equal to $\\frac{1}{3} S_{ABD} (h_E + h_C)$. Finally, if we consider the tetrahedra $EADC$ and $EBDC$ with a common face $EDC$, then the sum of their volumes is equal to $\\frac{1}{3} S_{ACD} (h_E + h_B)$.\n\nThe sum of the volumes of these three pairs of tetrahedra is equal to the doubled volume of the polyhedron, so the volume of the polyhedron is equal to\n$$V = \\frac{1}{6} (S_{ABC} (h_E + h_D) + S_{ABD} (h_E + h_C) + S_{ACD} (h_E + h_B)).$$\nWe need to find the smallest possible value of $V$.\n\n![Fig. 52](illustrations/fig52.png)\n\nIndeed, it has such a vertex from which 4 edges emerge to all other vertices (if only 3 edges emerged from each vertex, then there would be a total of $5 \\cdot 3 = 15$ ends of edges, but this number is equal to the doubled number of all edges and should be even). If $AB, AD, AC$, and $AE$ are four consecutive edges of a tetrahedral angle with vertex $A$, then our polyhedron is the union of tetrahedra $ABCD$ and $ABCE$ with a common base $ABC$. Let's estimate the volume of the polyhedron:\n$$V = \\frac{S(h_D + h_E)}{3},$$\nwhere $h_D$ and $h_E$ are the heights of the tetrahedra, dropped respectively from vertices $D$ and $E$ onto the base $ABC$, $S$ is the area of triangle $ABC$.\n\nLet $K$ be the intersection point of the segment $DE$ with the plane $ABC$; then $h_D + h_E \\le DK + KE = DE \\le 2$, since the distance between any two points on a sphere is not greater than its diameter. Let $R$ be the radius of the circle circumscribed around triangle $ABC$ (i.e., the section of the sphere by the plane $ABC$). Then (see problem 4-18 or 4-19)\n$$S \\le \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}R^2}{4} \\le \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4},$$\nsince the radius of any section of the sphere is not greater than the radius of the sphere. So, $V \\le \\frac{3}{2}$, and $V = \\frac{3}{2}$ in the case when $ABC$ is a regular triangle inscribed in the equator, and $D$ and $E$ are the poles of the sphere.\n\n$\\nabla$ The general problem: among all polyhedra inscribed in a sphere with $n$ vertices, find the polyhedron of maximum volume – is very difficult.\n\nIt can be shown that for $n = 6$, such a polyhedron will be a regular octahedron, but for $n = 8$, the polyhedron of the largest volume will not be a cube. For the planar analogue of this problem, the situation is much simpler: the largest in area inscribed in a given circle $n$-gon for each $n$ is, obviously, regular (this is a simple consequence of the convexity of the sine on the interval from 0 to $\\pi$, see the discussion of problem 4-18).\n\n**Problem 4-21.** Consider unit squares centered at all the nodes of the grid that are inside a circle of radius 10 (the sides of the squares are parallel to the grid lines).\n\nSince the length of the diagonal of such a square is $\\sqrt{2} < 2$, all these squares cover a circle of radius 9, concentric with the given circle. Therefore, the sum of their areas (numerically equal to the number of grid nodes) is greater than $81\\pi$ – the area of a circle of radius 9. $81\\pi > 251$.\n\n$\\nabla$ We can formulate a more general problem: estimate the number of solutions in integers $x, y$ of the inequality $x^2 + y^2 < n$ (in our problem, $n = 100$). From our reasoning, it follows that the number of solutions is not less than $\\pi(n-1)$ (see [91]).\n\n**Problem 4-22. Answer: impossible.**\n\nLet's draw a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the given point $O$. For each ray, we construct a conical surface with vertex $O$, whose axis is this ray, and the angle of the generatrix with the axis is $30^\\circ$; consider the \"cap\" – the part of the sphere lying inside this cone. The area of this \"cap\" (spherical segment) is equal to $2\\pi Rh$, where $h$ is the height of the \"cap\":\n$$h = R(1 - \\cos 30^\\circ) = R\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right),$$\nso the ratio of the area of the \"cap\" to the area $4\\pi R^2$ of the entire sphere is equal to\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) > \\frac{1}{15}.$$\n(The last inequality is equivalent to the following: $(2 - \\sqrt{3})^{15} > 4$, $26 > 15\\sqrt{3}$, $2^{12} = 4096 > 15^2 \\cdot 3 = 675$.)\n\nThus, some two of the 15 \"caps\" corresponding to 15 rays will necessarily intersect, and therefore, some two rays form an angle less than $60^\\circ$.\n\n$\\nabla$ We can pose a more general question: what is the largest value $\\alpha$ that the smallest of the angles between $n$ rays emanating from one point in space can take (or, equivalently, what is the largest size that $n$ identical non-intersecting \"caps\" on a sphere can have)? The exact answer to this question is known only for $n \\le 9$ and $n = 12$, although good estimates for the value of $\\alpha_n$ have been obtained for many values of $n$.\n\n**Problem 4-23.** Let's mark points on the circles: on the first – $A$, on the second – $B$. We will specify the position of the second circle relative to the first when they are superimposed by the angular value $t$ of the arc $AB$, $0^\\circ \\le t < 360^\\circ$ (the count goes counterclockwise).\n\nLet's call the value of $t$ forbidden if, with the corresponding arrangement of the circles, at least one pair of marked arcs intersects.\n\nConsider some arc of $25^\\circ$ and some arc of $30^\\circ$. They intersect on some interval of values of $t$ of magnitude $55^\\circ$. In total, there are no more such forbidden segments than pairs of arcs, i.e., $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$. Therefore, the set of forbidden values of $t$ has a total value of no more than $6 \\cdot 55^\\circ = 330^\\circ$ and does not cover the entire set of values of $t$ – from $0^\\circ$ to $360^\\circ$.\n\nThis means that there are also non-forbidden values of $t$ for which no pair of arcs intersects.\n\n$\\nabla$ Similarly, it can be proved that if non-overlapping arcs $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_m$ are marked on one unit circle, and arcs $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n$ are marked on the other, and\n$$m(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + ... + \\alpha_m) + n(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + ... + \\beta_n) < 360^\\circ,$$\nthen the circles can be aligned so that the marked arcs do not intersect.\n\nAn interesting and in some sense \"reverse\" question is: under what conditions on the numbers $\\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_m, \\beta_1, ..., \\beta_n$ is it possible to arrange the corresponding arcs so that some arcs overlap for any superposition of the circles?\n\nNote also that the method of our solution to problem 4-23 can be called a continuous analogue of the Dirichlet principle (see problem 2-9); and they have a common drawback: this method does not show how to find the required method of superposition.\n\n**Problem 4-24.** Let's carry out the weighing of the weights in three stages.\n\n1. Take two weights out of five and compare them. Let their masses be $a$ and $b$, and $a < b$. Take two more weights and compare them: $c < d$. Then compare the heavier weights of these pairs; we can assume that $b < d$.\n2. Find the place of the fifth weight with mass $e$ among the three $a < b < d$. Two weighings are enough for this: first, you need to compare $e$ with $b$, then you need to compare $e$ with $a$ if $e < b$, and with $d$ if $e > b$. Now we know how the four weights $a, b, d$, and $e$ are ordered.\n3. Find the place of the weight with mass $c$ among the three weights $a, b, e$; this will also take two weighings. Since after stage 1 we know that $c < d$, thus we will find the place of $c$ among the four remaining weights.\n\nAt stage 1, we made three weighings, at stages 2 and 3 – two weighings each, i.e., a total of 7 weighings.\n\n$\\nabla$ We will prove that it is impossible to order 5 weights in less than 7 weighings. Indeed, there are a total of $5! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 120$ options for ordering five weights. Each weighing has two outcomes. Therefore, $p$ weighings can make a choice of no more than $2^p$ options. (In the worst case for us, after the next weighing, the number of possible options is reduced by no more than half.) Therefore, in order for 5 weights to be ordered in $p$ weighings, the inequality $2^p \\ge 120$ must be satisfied, or $p \\ge \\log_2 120$, whence $p \\ge 7$.\n\nIn the general case, to order $n$ weights, at least $\\log_2(n!)$ weighings are definitely needed.\n\nThe general problem of the minimum number $F(n)$ of weighings for which $n$ weights can be ordered is far from being completely solved and is of great interest to programming specialists.\n\nSeveral general methods for ordering $n$ weights have been invented, but for large $n$, the number of weighings in all these methods exceeds $[\\log_2(n!)] + 1$. The simplest of them is the so-called \"binary insertion\" algorithm. At the $k$-th stage of this algorithm ($k = 1, 2, ..., n-1$), some new $(k+1)$-th weight is taken and its place is found among the chain of already ordered $k$ weights. First, it is compared in mass with the weight standing in the middle of this chain, then – with the weight in the middle of the half of the chain in which it turned out to be, and so on. At the $k$-th stage, no more than $[\\log_2 k] + 1$ weighings are spent. Thus, we can order $n$ weights in no more than\n$$(1 + \\log_2 2) + (1 + \\log_2 3) + ... + (1 + \\log_2(n-1)) < n(1 + \\log_2 n)$$\nweighings.\n\nSo, the minimum number $F(n)$ of weighings satisfies the inequalities\n$$\\log_2(n!) \\le F(n) < n(1 + \\log_2 n).$$\nOnly for $n \\le 4$ does the \"binary insertion\" algorithm give the correct values of $F(n)$: $F(2) = 1$, $F(3) = 3$, $F(4) = 5$. For the case $n = 5$, it requires 8, not $F(5) = 7$ weighings. A generalization of the weighing method that was indicated in the solution to the problem about five weights (the \"insertion and merge\" sorting algorithm [94]) gives the smallest possible number $F(n)$ of weighings for $n \\le 12$ and $n = 20, 21$, but it (as V.S. Grinberg told us) is not optimal for all $n$.\n\n## Independent Practice Problems\n\n**4-25.** Let $a$ and $b$ be the lengths of the legs, and $c$ and $h$ be the lengths of the hypotenuse and the height dropped on it of a right triangle.
