Answer: the train could move non-uniformly, and its average speed is not necessarily equal to 100 km/h. Let's show this. Let's divide the entire train travel time into 11 half-hour intervals. Let the train move exactly the same way as in the first half-hour during each odd half-hour, and cover k km during each such half-hour (0 ≤ k ≤ 100), and during each even half-hour, let it move exactly the same way as in the second half-hour, and cover (100−k) km during each even half-hour. Then, no matter how the train moves during the first two half-hours - uniformly or not - the train will cover exactly 100 km during each hour of movement.\n\nTo answer question b), let's find the average speed of the train. The distance traveled by the train during all odd half-hour intervals is equal to 6k, and the distance covered during all even intervals is equal to 5(100−k). Thus, during the entire 5.5 hours of movement, the train covered 6k + 5(100 − k) = 500 + k. Therefore, its average speed is equal to $\\frac{500 + k}{5.5}$ (km/h). For k ≠ 50, this speed is not equal to 100 km/h.\n\n∇ In our example, the train's movement was periodic with a period T = 1 hour. It can be shown that such periodicity of the speed of movement follows from the conditions of the problem. From our reasoning, it can be seen that the average speed of the train can be any number in the interval from 1000/11 (when k = 0) to 1200/11 (when k = 100) km/h.\n\n**Problem 5-2.** Answer: it can. Here's an example:\n\n2; 2; 2; 2; −9; 2; 2; 2; 2; −9; 2; 2.\n\nHere, the differences between the person's income and expenses (balance) for each month of the year are written in a row (taking into account the sign). We see that the sum of any five consecutive numbers in the written chain is negative (equal to −1), and in general, for the year, the sum of all numbers is positive (equal to 2).\n\n∇ Generalization of this problem: n numbers are written in a row, while the sum of any k adjacent numbers is negative; can the sum of all n numbers be positive in such a situation? The answer here is: if n is a multiple of k, then this cannot be, and if n is not divisible by k, then it can. In our problem, n = 12, k = 5.\n\nThis statement can, in turn, also be generalized. Let m numbers be written in a row. Let's call the sum of q consecutive numbers from this row a q-sum. Then if for natural numbers m, n, and k the inequality $m \\le n + k − d − 1$ is satisfied, where $d = gcd(n, k)$ is the greatest common divisor of the numbers n and k, then it is possible to write m numbers in a row so that all its n-sums have one sign, and all k-sums have another sign. Moreover, all these sums can take any pre-specified values.\n\nIn fact, let's compose a system of k + n − 2d linear equations with k + n − d − 1 unknowns:\n\n$x_1 + ... + x_n = a_1,$\n$x_2 + ... + x_{n+1} = a_2,$\n...\n$x_{k-d} + ... + x_{k+n-d-1} = a_{k-d},$\n$x_1 + ... + x_k = b_1,$\n$x_2 + ... + x_{k+1} = b_2,$\n...\n$x_{n-d} + ... + x_{k+n-d-1} = b_{n-d}.$\n\nIt can be shown that this system is consistent: its matrix has the maximum possible rank k + n − 2d. If the numbers n and k are relatively prime (d = 1), then it has a unique solution; if d > 1, then the system has d − 1 free unknowns.\n\nThus, for given n and k, one can find a row of n + k − d − 1 numbers that satisfy the condition. If $m \\le n + k − d − 1$, then the row formed by the first m numbers of the already written row also satisfies the condition.\n\nLet's now show that if $m \\ge n + k − d$, then there is no such row of m numbers that all its n-sums have one sign, and all k-sums have another.\n\nSuppose, on the contrary, that such a row of n + k − d numbers has been found, and let n > k. Let's cross out the first k numbers. Then, in the row of the remaining n − d numbers, all k-sums still have the same sign, and all (n − k)-sums have a different sign. Since\n\nn − d = (n − k) + k − d,\n\nwe have moved from the problem with parameters n and k to the problem with smaller numbers: k and n − k. Repeating this procedure (similar to the Euclidean algorithm), we will arrive at a situation where there is a row of numbers in which all d-sums have one sign, and all ld-sums have a different sign, which is obviously impossible. (Note that by a similar procedure – descent from (n, k) to (k, n − k), similar to the Euclidean algorithm, one can also prove the consistency of the system written above.)\n\nFinally, it is clear that if there is no row of n + k − d numbers that satisfies the condition, then it is impossible to write a longer such row.\n\n**Problem 5-3.** Answer: it is possible. Indeed:\n\n$203 = 7 + 29 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 7 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot ... \\cdot 1.$\n      167 ones             167 ones\n\n∇ Let's ask the question: which natural numbers cannot be represented simultaneously as a sum and as a product of several (the same) natural numbers?\n\nThe answer to this question is: prime numbers.\n\nThe following question related to problem 5-3 is also interesting: for which natural values of k does the equation\n\n$x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k = x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot x_k$\n\nhave a non-zero integer solution?\n\nIt turns out that for all values of $k$. For example:\n\nfor $k = 1$: $x_1 = 1$;\nfor $k = 2$: $x_1 = x_2 = 2$;\nfor $k > 2$: $x_1 = x_2 = ... = x_{k-2} = 1$, $x_{k-1} = 2$, $x_k = k$ \n(see [109], problems 186–189).\n\n**Problem 5-4.** Answer: false.\n\nCounterexample: 6, 10, 15, 77, 91, 143.\n\nFrom these six numbers, $2 \\cdot 3$, $2 \\cdot 5$, $3 \\cdot 5$, $7 \\cdot 11$, $7 \\cdot 13$, $11 \\cdot 13$, no three have a common prime factor, but two out of every three are included in the first or second triple and therefore are not relatively prime.\n\nThis is clearly seen in the diagram – see Figure 54. Each vertex of the triangle has one of the numbers, and each side has a common factor of the numbers at its ends.\n\n∇ If you add one more word to the condition of the problem, the statement will become true: from any six natural numbers, you can choose either three pairwise relatively prime numbers, or three numbers that pairwise have a common divisor greater than one.\n\n![Fig. 54](illustrations/fig54.png)\n\nFor connoisseurs, this problem will undoubtedly remind you of this: among six people, you can always choose three pairwise acquaintances or three pairwise strangers.\n\n**Problem 5-5.** a) Answer: true.\n\nLet $a$ and $b$ be the largest and smallest of the written numbers. If there is a number between them, then the statement is true. If they are next to each other, then there are two more numbers either to the right or to the left of them. They form the desired triple of numbers either with the number $a$ or with the number $b$.\n\nFor connoisseurs. There is a general theorem on this subject: in a partially ordered set consisting of $mn + 1$ elements, there will always be either a chain of length $m + 1$ or $n + 1$ pairwise incomparable elements (this theorem is a consequence of the well-known Dilworth's theorem: in a partially ordered set, the minimum number of chains containing all elements of the set is equal to the maximum number of pairwise incomparable elements).\n\nWhen considering five numbers, they can be ordered like this. We will assume that for the numbers $a$ and $b$, the relation $a \\prec b$ holds if $a$ is less than $b$ and the number $a$ is to the left of the number $b$ in the written row. The numbers $c$ and $d$ turn out to be incomparable in this sense if and only if they are in decreasing order in the written row.\n\nSince $5 = 2 \\cdot 2 + 1$ ($m = n = 2$), it follows from the formulated theorem that from five numbers, there will always be three that go either in increasing order (chain of length $m + 1 = 3$) or in decreasing order ($n + 1 = 3$ pairwise incomparable elements). If in the formulated\n\nb) Answer: false.\n\nLet's give a counterexample – nine numbers: 3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7.\n\nLet's prove that no four digits in this sequence are in either ascending or descending order. To do this, we divide the members of the sequence into three triples: 321, 654, 987.\n\nIf any two digits out of these nine are in decreasing order (the one that is smaller is further from the beginning of the sequence), then they are necessarily from the same triple. This means that you cannot choose more than three digits in decreasing order, since all these digits must be in the same triple.\n\nIf any two digits out of these nine are in ascending order, then they are necessarily from different triples. Since there are only three triples, you cannot choose more than three digits in ascending order.\n\n**Problem 5-6.** a) Answer: it can.\n\nExample – two numbers, 2 and −1: $2 + (-1) = 1$; $2^3 + (-1)^3 = 7 > 1$.\n\nb) Answer: it can.\n\nExample – eight numbers: two numbers, each of which is equal to 0.8, and six numbers, each of which is equal to -0.1:\n\n$2 \\cdot 0.8 + 6 \\cdot (-0.1) = 1$; $(0.8)^3 + 6 \\cdot (-0.1)^3 = 1.018 > 1$.\n\nFor connoisseurs. This idea – adding many negative numbers to positive numbers, but smaller in magnitude – helps to answer the following question: can the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n$ converge, and the series of cubes $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n^3$ diverge? The answer to this question is positive. Here's an example:\n\nThe series \n\n$\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) + ... + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} \\right) + ...$ (*)\n\nis constructed as follows: after the sum $\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)$, we put $2^3 = 8$ sums $\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right)$, then $3^3 = 27$ sums $\\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} \\right)$, ..., then $n^3$ sums $\\left(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{2n} - \\frac{1}{2n} \\right)$, etc.\n\nThe specified series converges, since the sum of $N$ of its first terms, where $3^{1+2+3+...+n} < N \\le 3^{1+2+...+n+(n+1)}$, does not exceed the number $\\frac{1}{2(n+1)}$ (it is either equal to zero or equal to $\\frac{1}{2(n+1)}$).\n\nThe series of cubes of the terms of the series (*) diverges, since the sum of $n^3$ terms is equal to $\\frac{3}{4}$, therefore the sum of the first $3(1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3)$ terms is equal to $\\frac{3n^4}{4}$ and, therefore, grows indefinitely.\n\nIt can be proved that only for functions of the form $f(x) = kx$ in some neighborhood of zero, the convergence of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n$ implies the convergence of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} f(a_n)$.\n\n**Problem 5-7.** a) Answer: true.\n\nConsider the function $y = F(x) = f\\left(x + \\frac{1}{5}\\right) - f(x)$, defined and continuous on the segment $[0; \\frac{4}{5}]$. We need to prove that there is a point $x_0$ on this segment such that $F(x_0) = 0$. By the definition of the function $y = F(x)$, we have:\n\n$F(0) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) - f(0)$, (1)\n$F\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) - f\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)$, (2)\n$F\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) - f\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)$, (3)\n$F\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) - f\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)$, (4)\n$F\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = f(1) - f\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)$. (5)\n\nSince $f(0) = f(1)$, by adding equalities (1)–(5) term by term, we get\n\n$F(0) + F\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) + F\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) + F\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) + F\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = 0$. (*)\n\nEquality (*) is possible only in two cases: either all five terms in its left-hand side are equal to zero – then the problem is solved, or among these terms there are numbers of different signs. Let $F(x_1)$ and $F(x_2)$ be numbers of different signs, where $0 \\le x_1 < x_2 \\le \\frac{4}{5}$. Then, due to the continuity of the function $F(x)$, there is a number $x_0$ ($x_1 < x_0 < x_2$) such that $F(x_0) = 0$, which was required.\n\nb) Answer: false, the graph may not have such a chord.\n\nFigure 55 shows the required example. Let's explain how it is constructed.\n\nLet points A and B be the ends of the segment [0; 1], point C be its midpoint, and points D and E divide it into three equal parts.\n\n![Fig. 55](illustrations/fig55.png)\n\nLet's draw parallel inclined lines $l_1$, $l_2$, and $l_3$ through points A, C, and B, and intersecting lines $m_1$ and $m_2$ through points D and E, such that $m_1 \\perp m_2$. Denoting by $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$, and $P_4$ the points of intersection of the lines $l_1$, $l_2$, and $l_3$ with the lines $m_1$ and $m_2$ closest to the abscissa axis, we obtain the broken line $AP_1DP_2CP_3EP_4B$. Let's show that this broken line serves as the desired example.\n\nFirstly, it is the graph of a continuous function $f(x)$ on the segment [0; 1], and $f(0) = f(1) = 0$.\n\nSecondly, it does not have a chord of length 2/5 parallel to the abscissa axis. Indeed, if the ends of the chord parallel to the Ox axis lie on adjacent links of the broken line, then it obviously does not exceed the segment DE, which is equal to 1/3. If the ends of the chord lie on links \"through one\" or \"through two\", then it is not less than the segment AC, which is equal to 1/2. Since $\\frac{1}{3} < \\frac{2}{5} < \\frac{1}{2}$, our statement is proved.\n\n∇ Similar to the solution of problem 5-7 a), it can be proved that for the graph of the function $y = f(x)$ given in its condition, there exists a chord of length $\\frac{1}{n}$, parallel to the abscissa axis ($n$ is any natural number) – see [62].\n\nFor connoisseurs. The last statement is a special case of Levy's theorem: if a plane continuum has a chord of length $a$, then it has a chord of length $\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot a$ (where $n$ is an arbitrary natural number) and a chord of length $\\alpha$ parallel to it (where $0 < \\alpha < 1$).\n\nOn the other hand, for any number $\\alpha$ ($0 < \\alpha < 1$) that is not representable in the form $\\frac{1}{n}$ (where $n$ is a natural number), it is possible, similarly to the solution of problem 5-7 b), to construct an example of a plane continuum that has a chord of length 1 and does not have a parallel chord of length $\\alpha$ – see [99].\n\nNote also that for a periodic continuous function on a straight line, the situation is completely different: its graph will have a horizontal chord of any given length.\n\n**Problem 5-8.** Answer: it can.\n\nLet's give an example. As the first one, we take an equilateral triangle with a side length of 1/2 cm, and as the second one – an isosceles triangle with a base of 200 m and a height of $10^{-7}$ m. Its lateral side is greater than half the base, i.e., greater than 100 m, and its area is equal to $\\frac{10^{-5}}{2}$ m$^2$ and thus less than the area of the first triangle, which is equal to $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{16}$ cm$^2$.\n\n**Problem 5-9.** a) Answer: it can.\n\nLet's give an example. Consider an isosceles triangle with a base of 800 cm and a height of 0.3 cm. Its area is equal to $\\frac{800 \\cdot 0.3}{2} = 120$ cm$^2$ and thus greater than 100 cm$^2$. Let's show that this triangle satisfies the condition. Indeed, its height AH, dropped on the lateral side BC (Fig. 56), is equal to twice the length of the perpendicular DK, dropped from the midpoint of the base D to the lateral side BC, and this perpendicular, in turn, is less than the inclined line BD. From this it follows that the height AH is less than 0.6 cm and, therefore, all the heights of the triangle ABC are less than 1 cm.\n\n![Fig. 56](illustrations/fig56.png)\n\nb) Answer: it cannot.\n\nSince the heights of the triangle are greater than 2 cm, its sides are also greater than 2 cm, and then its area is greater than $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2$ (cm$^2$).\n\n**Problem 5-10.** Answer: false.\n\nThe counterexample is shown in Figure 57. We took three vertices A, B, and D of the quadrilateral ABCD very close to each other, and the fourth vertex C and the point O inside the quadrilateral – close to each other and far from A, B, and D.\n\n![Fig. 57](illustrations/fig57.png)\n\nFor connoisseurs. Let's pose a more general question. For what $k$ is the sum of the distances from any point lying inside the quadrilateral to the vertices of the quadrilateral less than $kP$ ($P$ – the perimeter of the quadrilateral)? Answer: for $k \\ge \\frac{3}{2}$. Let's explain why this is so.\n\nFor each quadrilateral ABCD, the point for which the sum of the distances to the vertices is maximum is one of its vertices.\n\nIndeed, the function (on the plane) $M \\to AM$, where A is a fixed point of the plane, is convex (its graph is a cone), and the sum of four convex functions \n\n$f(M) = AM + BM + CM + DM$\n\nis also convex. The largest value of a convex function on a polygon is reached at its vertex.\n\nLet's now show that this largest value is less than $kP$ ($P$ is the perimeter of the quadrilateral). Answer: for $k \\ge \\frac{3}{2}$. Let's explain why this is so.\n\nFor each quadrilateral $ABCD$, the point for which the sum of the distances to the vertices is maximum is one of its vertices.\n\nIndeed, the function (on the plane) $M \\to AM$, where A is a fixed point of the plane, is convex (its graph is a cone), and the sum of four convex functions \n\n$f(M) = AM + BM + CM + DM$\n\nis also convex. The largest value of a convex function on a polygon is reached at its vertex.\n\nLet's now show that this largest value is less than $\\frac{3}{2}P$. Let it be achieved at vertex $A$.  Adding the inequalities $AC < AB + BC$ and $AC < AD + DC$ term by term, we get $2|AC| < P$, and even more so, \n\n$2AC < P + 2(BC + CD)$.\n\nAdding the sum $2AB + 2AD$ to both sides of the last inequality, we obtain the required inequality\n\n$AB + AC + AD < \\frac{3}{2}P$\n\n(see [24]).\n\nFor any $k < \\frac{3}{2}$ it is possible to construct a counterexample by setting $MA = MB = MD = CO = \\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is a sufficiently small number (see Figure 57).\n\nNote also that to find the point inside a given convex quadrilateral with the smallest sum of distances to the vertices, you do not need to be a great expert: this is the point of intersection of its diagonals.\n\n**Problem 5-11.** Answer: it is possible.\n\nFigure 58 shows how to cut a right-angled isosceles triangle with a leg length of 7 cm into 6 pairwise different right-angled isosceles triangles.\n\n![Fig. 58](illustrations/fig58.png)\n\n∇ It turns out that the following statement is true: a right-angled isosceles triangle can be cut into any number greater than 10 of pairwise unequal right-angled isosceles triangles.\n\nFirst, let's show how you can cut it into any even number of parts $2k$, where $k \\ge 3$. We will start from a right-angled isosceles triangle $ABC$ with a right angle $C$. Let's extend its legs $CA$ and $CB$ and draw a line $l$ through the vertex $B$ perpendicular to the hypotenuse – see Figure 59.\n\n![Fig. 59](illustrations/fig59.png)\n\nLet's construct a broken line $AB_1A_1B_2A_2B_3...B_kA_k$, all links $B_iA_i$ of which are parallel to the line $AB$, and all links $A_iB_{i+1}$ are parallel to the line $BC$; through the last link $B_kA_k$ of the broken line, we draw a line that will intersect the line $BC$ at some point $D$. As a result, we will arrive, as is easy to show, at a right-angled isosceles triangle $DCA$, divided in the required way into $2k + 2$ similar pairwise unequal right-angled isosceles triangles (a special case of this construction for $k = 2$ is used in the solution of problem 5-11). In the chain of triangles $ABC$, $BAB_1$, $A_1BA_1$, $A_1BB_2$, $B_2AA_2$, ..., $A_{k-1}B_kA_k$, each subsequent triangle is similar to the previous one with a similarity coefficient of $\\sqrt{2}$ (the hypotenuse of the previous triangle is equal to the leg of the next one), therefore, in the sequence of segments $CA$, $AA_1$, $A_1A_2$, ..., $A_{k-1}A_k$, each subsequent one is twice as long as the previous one. From this follows a practical way of cutting a given triangle in the required way.\n\nLet it be required to divide a right-angled isosceles triangle with a leg $a$ into $2k + 2$ parts. Let's set aside segments of length $\\frac{a}{2^{k-1}}$, $\\frac{2a}{2^{k-1}}$, $\\frac{4a}{2^{k-1}}$, ..., $\\frac{2^{k-1}a}{2^{k-1}}$ sequentially from the vertex of the right angle on the leg (since $1 + 2 + ... + 2^{k-1} = 2^k - 1$, this can be done); the obtained points will be the vertices $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$, ..., $A_k$ of the broken line of the construction described above.\n\nSo, you can cut the triangle into $2k$ parts for $k \\ge 3$.\n\nSince the smaller of the triangles obtained in this way can again be cut into 6 parts in the way indicated above, we can cut the original triangle into $2k + 5l$ parts, where $k$ is any integer greater than 3, and $l$ is any natural number. In our construction, the ends of the rods form two equilateral triangles, located in planes perpendicular to the line connecting their centers and rotated by a certain angle relative to each other. The rods themselves lie on pairwise intersecting lines.\n\n∇ The connection of rods and threads in Figure 60 is the same as that of an octahedron (it forms the graph of an octahedron – see Fig. 67 for problem 5-15). It is difficult to mathematically prove the existence of such a construction (sufficiency of the condition $d = l \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{k^2}{3}}$).\n\n![Fig. 60](illustrations/fig60.png)\n\nThis connection was invented in the 1960s by the architect B. Fuller. After him, many different designs of this type appeared. When writing this book, the authors set the following task: to make a rigid spatial structure from rods and threads so that the rods do not touch each other and exactly two threads depart from each end of the rods. Such a connection was made by the architect V. Koleichuk. The connection diagram is shown in Figure 61.\n\n![Fig. 61](illustrations/fig61.png)\n\nArchitect, engineer, and designer Richard Buckminster Fuller gained the most fame thanks to his constructions called \"geodesic dome\". He introduced the term \"tensegrity\" associated with them.\n\nHowever, the architect Vyacheslav Koleichuk, who dealt a lot with such systems in the 90s of the last century, questioned the priority of B. Fuller. He argued that such systems were first invented by our domestic constructivist Karl Ioganson in 1921. A large number of modern studies are devoted to these systems with applications in interactive and adaptive structures.\n\nIn architecture, the term \"tensegrity\" was defined by B. Fuller as \"the property of frame structures, in which whole parts loaded in tension and composite parts loaded in compression are involved, to work in such a way that each part functions with maximum efficiency and economy\".\n\nInterestingly, the writer and anthropologist Carlos Castaneda (with the personal permission of B. Fuller!) used the term \"tensegrity\" to refer to a system of breathing, movements, and body positions developed by Indian shamans who lived in ancient Mexico, aimed at forming certain properties and qualities of a person engaged in this system. Thus, tensegrity according to Castaneda is a modernized version of some movements and breathing called \"magical passes\".\n\nThe concept of \"tensegrity\" is also used in the study of processes in biology (especially in cell biology) and in some other industries, for example, in studies of the structure of textile fabrics, design, research of social structures, ensemble music and geodesy.\n\nWe especially note the application of the mathematical basis of this concept in chemistry. At the end of the 20th century, there was a great interest in fullerenes (of course, named after B. Fuller) or buckyballs. This is the name of molecular compounds belonging to the class of allotropic forms of carbon (Allotropy – the property of the existence of the same type of chemical element in the form of two or more simple substances that differ in structure and properties. For example, graphite and diamond are allotropic forms of carbon; other forms are diamond, carbyne and graphite) and representing convex closed polyhedra composed of an even number (three-coordinated) carbon atoms (this is the principle according to which the geodesic constructions of B. Fuller are built). At first, only structures were considered, including only pentagonal and hexagonal faces. According to Euler's theorem for polyhedra, if $n$, $e$, and $f$ are the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron, respectively, then $n - e + f = 2$. Using this theorem, it can be proved that a necessary condition for the existence of the polyhedron indicated above is the presence of exactly 12 pentagonal faces and $\\frac{n}{2} - 10$ hexagonal faces. In addition to carbon atoms, atoms of other chemical elements can also be included in the composition of fullerene molecules.\n\nThe possibility of the existence of fullerenes was predicted in 1971 in Japan, and theoretically substantiated in 1973 in the USSR. For the discovery of fullerenes, H. Kroto, R. Smalley and R. Curl were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996. Currently, intensive study of these compounds continues.\n\n**Problem 5-13.** Answer: it is possible.\n\nConsider a cube $ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1$ with edge $a$ (Fig. 62, a) and a spatial hexagon $AA_1B_1C_1CD_1$ (its vertices do not lie in the same plane). It turns out that through this hexagon (and hence through the cube) it is possible to freely stretch a cube with edge $a$ without touching its sides.\n\n![Fig. 62](illustrations/fig62.png)\n\nTo verify this, let's depict in Figure 62, b the projection of the cube onto a plane perpendicular to its diagonal $BD_1$. Due to the symmetry of the cube, this projection is a regular hexagon $A'A_1'B'C'C_1'D'$, where $A'$ is the projection of the point $A$, $A_1'$ is the projection of the point $A_1$, etc. Thus, the contour of the hexagon $A'A_1'B'C'C_1'D'$ is the projection of the spatial hexagon $AAB_1C_1CD_1$, and both ends of the diagonal of the cube $BD_1$ are projected to the center $O$ of the regular hexagon.\n\nSince the sine of the angle between any edge of the cube and its diagonal is equal to $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$, the side of the regular hexagon is equal to $a\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$, and the radius of the circle inscribed in it is equal to $\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ – half the diagonal of the square with side $a$. Therefore, a square with a center at point $O$ and a side $a$ will fit entirely in the hexagon without touching its sides, as shown in Figure 62, b.\n\nFrom this it follows that if you put a cube with edge $a$ so that its lower face coincides with the square in Figure 62, b, and move the cube perpendicular to the plane of the hexagon, then the cube will not touch the sides of the hexagon. This means that it can also be stretched through a spatial hexagon along the diagonal $BD_1$.\n\nThus, a through hole can be made in a wooden cube through which the same cube can be stretched – see Figure 63.\n\n![Fig. 63](illustrations/fig63.png)\n\n∇ From the above reasoning, it follows that through a cube with edge $a$ it is possible to stretch even a cube of slightly larger dimensions than itself, namely any cube with an edge less than $(\\sqrt{3} - 1)a$.\n\n**Problem 5-14.** Answer: it exists.\n\nFigure 64 shows an example of such a polyhedron. It is obtained as follows: on the edge $BD$ of the tetrahedron $ABCD$, a \"notch\" of two triangular faces – $GEH$ and $GFH$ – is made. It has 8 vertices, 6 faces, 12 edges.\n\n![Fig. 64](illustrations/fig64.png)\n\n∇ In the polyhedron shown in Figure 64, two faces are hexagons with two common edges, $BE$ and $FD$. In a convex polyhedron, such a situation is impossible: two faces of a convex polyhedron can have no more than one common edge.\n\n**Problem 5-15.** a) Answer: it is possible. An example is shown in Figure 65.\n\n![Fig. 65](illustrations/fig65.png)\n\n∇ This problem resembles the well-known problem \"about houses and wells\": is it possible to draw nine non-intersecting roads on a plane that connect each of the three \"houses\" with each of the three \"wells\"? In this network of roads (as well as in problem 5-15) there are 6 vertices and 3 segments depart from each vertex (Fig. 66). However, the answer to the question \"about houses and wells\" is negative: such a network cannot be drawn. The reason for this fact is Euler's theorem: let $n$ be the number of vertices, $m$ be the number of segments connecting some of these vertices, $f$ be the number of polygons into which the plane is divided by these segments; then $n + f = m + 1$ (see [92]).\n\n![Fig. 66](illustrations/fig66.png)\n\nFor connoisseurs. There is a theorem (Wagner, Fáry, Stein): if a graph can be depicted on a plane without intersections, then it can be depicted on a plane so that all its edges are segments. A necessary and sufficient condition for the planarity of a graph is the Pontryagin–Kuratowski theorem: a graph can be depicted on a plane without intersections if and only if it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to a graph with six vertices of the \"houses – wells\" type or a complete graph with five vertices (five points, pairwise connected by edges) (see [92]).\n\nb) Answer: it is possible.\n\nThe example is shown in Figure 67. It can be assumed that a wire octahedron is depicted here (Fig. 68), photographed from a point lying near the center of one of its faces.\n\n![Fig. 67](illustrations/fig67.png)\n\n![Fig. 68](illustrations/fig68.png)\n\n**Problem 5-16.** a) Answer: it exists. The example is shown in Figure 69.\n\n![Fig. 69](illustrations/fig69.png)\n\n∇ For any even $n \\ge 6$, there exists a closed broken line of $n$ links that intersects each of its links exactly once. An example for $n = 6$ has already been constructed, and for $n \\ge 8$, Figure 70 shows the construction of part of such a broken line (the rule for constructing the rest is clear).\n\n![Fig. 70](illustrations/fig70.png)\n\nb) Answer: it does not exist.\n\nSuppose that we managed to construct such a broken line. Let's consider any point of its self-intersection. Two links intersect at it, and they do not intersect with any other links. Therefore, all links of the broken line can be divided into pairs corresponding to the points of its self-intersection. This means that there is an even number of links and there cannot be seven.\n\n∇ This reasoning shows that in general there is no broken line with an odd number of links that intersects each of its links exactly once.\n\n**Problem 5-17.** Answer: a) it is possible; b) it is impossible.\n\na) Figure 71, a shows how you can decompose 24 coins in the required way. Let's explain how this is done.\n\nLet the radius of the coins be $R$. Let's place the centers of four coins at the vertices of a rhombus with side $2R$. From such rhombuses, you can type the desired patterns, joining them with extreme (located on a large diagonal) coins.\n\n![Fig. 71](illustrations/fig71.png)\n\nb) Suppose that 25 coins are laid out on the plane in the required way, and we arrive at a contradiction.\n\nMark on the edge of each coin the three places where it touches the three others. Let's count the total number of marked places in two ways. On the one hand, the number of marked places is even, since these places are divided into pairs at the points of contact of the coins. On the other hand, the number of marked places is odd, since it is equal to the number of coins 25 multiplied by 3.\n\nThe resulting contradiction proves our statement.\n\n∇ It is interesting to find out for which $k$ it is impossible to arrange a certain (finite) number of identical round coins on a plane so that each touches $k$ of the others. It turns out that this cannot be done for $k > 3$. Let's prove it.\n\nSuppose that identical round coins are laid out on a plane so that each of them touches $k$ others. Mark the centers of all coins on the plane and consider their convex hull – the smallest convex polygon containing them. Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be three consecutive vertices of it; then the angle $ABC$ is less than 180°. Let the coin centered at point $B$ touch the coins centered at $O_1$, $O_2$, ..., $O_k$ (the centers are numbered in the order of traversal around point $B$ in one of the two possible directions). It is easily shown that each of the angles $O_1BO_2$, $O_2BO_3$, ..., $O_{k-1}BO_k$ is not less than 60°. From this it follows that the inequality $k \\cdot 60° \\le 180°$ must be satisfied, which implies that $k \\le 3$.\n\nLet's now show how, for $k = 3$, it is possible to decompose any sufficiently large even number of coins in the required way. For this, it is convenient to use blanks of two types: a \"rhombus\" of four coins and a \"flashlight\" of six coins.\n\nIt is easy to assemble a chain of 16 coins from four \"rhombuses\". Figure 71, b shows how these \"rhombuses\" and \"flashlights\" can be folded into a closed chain containing 18 coins. Any larger even number can be represented as a sum of $4n + 6m$ and assemble the corresponding chain from $n$ \"rhombuses\" and $m$ \"flashlights\".\n\nSimilar questions about the arrangement of balls in space are interesting. In 1953, it was proved that no more than 12 identical balls can be attached to a ball in space [116].\n\n**Problem 5-18.** Answer: it can.\n\nLet's assign a point to each person, and different points to different people. If two people know each other, then we connect the corresponding points with a segment. Then the problem will be reduced to the following: is there a diagram that does not have triangles, and any two points are either connected by a segment or are opposite vertices of exactly one quadrilateral?\n\nFigure 72, a, b shows two simplest examples of such schemes. We need to give an example of a scheme consisting of more than four points. Figure 72, c shows an example of a scheme of 16 points and 40 segments that satisfies the condition. The resulting scheme satisfies the condition of the problem. This can be verified by enumeration, which is simplified due to the symmetry of the scheme.\n\n![Fig. 72](illustrations/fig72.png)\n\n∇ It is interesting that the configuration described in the solution of problem 5-18 can be described as a set of vertices, edges, and large diagonals of a four-dimensional cube.\n\nIt can be shown that under the conditions of problem 5-18, each person in a given company has the same number of acquaintances. Indeed, let for each person $A$, $M_A$ denote the set of his acquaintances, and $N_A$ denote the set of people unfamiliar with $A$. Then each element from $N_A$ can be associated with a pair of elements from $M_A$ (those with whom he is familiar). It is not difficult to prove that the correspondence between the set $N_A$ and the set of all possible pairs of elements of $M_A$ will be one-to-one. Therefore, if $M_A$ contains $m_A$ elements, then $N_A$ contains $\\frac{1}{2}m_A(m_A - 1)$ elements, and in total, the company will have $n = 1 + m_A + \\frac{1}{2}m_A(m_A - 1)$ people. This equality holds for any person $A$.\n\nBut the equation \n$1 + x + \\frac{1}{2}x(x-1) = n$ \nhas (for $n > 1$) only one positive root, so the number $m_A$ is the same for all $A$ (see [10]).\n\nWe do not know the complete answer to the question of for which values of $n$ such companies exist. As shown above, $n = 1 + \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$, where $m$ is the number of acquaintances of one person. It is not difficult to prove that such companies do not exist for $m = 3$, $m = 4$, and for $m = 4k + 3$, where $k$ is any natural number. All examples of such companies known to us are shown in Figure 72, a, b, c.\n\n**Problem 5-19.** Answer: it could.\n\nFigure 73 schematically shows the results of all games of the chess players' tournament, satisfying the condition of the problem. In it, each pair of chess players\n\n![Fig. 73](illustrations/fig73.png)\n\nplayed 7 games. In this case:\n\n– the first one won two games against the second one;\n– the second one won two games against the first one;\n– the first one won three games against the third one;\n– the third one won four games against the first one;\n– the rest of the tournament games ended in a draw.\n\nIn this tournament, the first chess player scored 6.5 points, the second one – 7 points, the third one – 7.5 points; at the same time, the first one won the most – 5 games, the second one lost the least – 2 games, and the third one scored the most points.\n\n![Fig. 74](illustrations/fig74.png)\n\n∇ You can make a tournament table (Fig. 74): denote all the number of wins (+), losses (–), and draws (=) with letters and write down all the conditions of the problem. This will result in a system of linear inequalities with a large number of variables. The solution of problem 5-19 shows that this system has at least one solution in natural numbers. Of course, it is not unique; it is interesting to obtain a description of all solutions. For a detailed discussion of this problem, see [39, 40].\n\n**Problem 5-20.** Answer: it is possible.\nThe filling method is shown in Figure 75, different colors are shown in this figure with different hatching.\n\n![Fig. 75](illustrations/fig75.png)\n\n∇ When $n$ different symbols are written in an $n \\times n$ table so that all different symbols are in each row and each column, it is said that a Latin square is given. Two Latin squares $A$ and $B$ are called orthogonal if in those cells where the $i$-th symbol is in square $A$, all symbols are different in square $B$ (and so for each ($i = 1, 2, ..., n$).\n\nOur task was to construct three pairwise orthogonal Latin squares $4 \\times 4$ (one gives the color, the second – the shape of the frame, and the third – the letter).\n\nFor connoisseurs. To compile similar square tables (they are useful in applied problems, for example, in planning multi-purpose experiments), it is convenient to use the concept of a finite affine plane (see [42]).\n\nLet $F$ be a finite field of $q$ elements; pairs $(x; y)$ of elements of $F$ will be called points of the finite affine plane, and sets of the form $\\{(x;y): ax + by + c = 0\\}$, where $a$, $b$, $c \\in F$, and $a$ or $b$ is not equal to zero, are called lines.\n\nIn total, there are $q^2$ points and $q(q + 1)$ lines, and they are divided into $q + 1$ families so that in each family there are exactly $q$ lines \"parallel\" to each other, and $q + 1$ lines pass through each point.\n\nFor example, one family is the lines $x + c = 0$, another is $y + c = 0$, the third is $x + y + c = 0$, the fourth (if $q > 2$) is $x + 2y + c = 0$, and so on.\n\nLet's assign a certain property to each of the $q + 1$ families: \"column number\", \"row number\", \"letter\", \"frame shape\", etc. Let's assign a certain row number to the points of each of the $q$ lines of the first family, a certain column number to the points of each of the lines of the second family, a letter to the third, a frame shape to the fourth, and so on. Then we will get a way to find out in which cell of the table $q \\times q$ to place each point $(x; y)$, what color to assign to it, what letter, etc. Any two non-parallel lines intersect at one point, so that for any two given properties there is exactly one cell with the desired pair of properties.\n\nFor $q = 4$, there is a finite field of elements 0, 1, $a$, $b$, leading precisely to the solution of our problem. The addition and multiplication tables in this field are given below.\n\n| + | 0 | 1 | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 1 | a | b |\n| 1 | 1 | 0 | b | a |\n| a | a | b | 0 | 1 |\n| b | b | a | 1 | 0 |\n\n| × | 0 | 1 | a | b |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | a | b |\n| a | 0 | a | b | 1 |\n| b | 0 | b | 1 | a |\n\nIt can be shown that there are no more than $n - 1$ pairwise orthogonal Latin squares of order $n$. Moreover, the existence of $n - 1$ such squares is equivalent to the existence of a projective plane of order $n$ (see the solution of the next problem 5-21 about the projective plane). If $n$ is a prime number or a power of a prime number, then a projective plane of order $n$ exists. For other $n$, the existence of a projective plane of order $n$ is an unsolved problem.\n\nIn 1782, Leonhard Euler proposed the following problem.\n\nIs it possible to arrange 36 officers of six different ranks, taken from six different regiments, in the form of a $6 \\times 6$ square so that each row and each column contains officers of each rank and from each regiment?\n\nIn other words, L. Euler asked if there are two orthogonal Latin squares of order 6.\n\nIt can be shown that if $n$ does not give a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then two orthogonal squares of order $n$ exist. L. Euler suggested that if $n$ gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then there are no such squares.\n\nFor $n = 2$, Euler's hypothesis is easy to verify, so $n = 6$ is the first difficult case. In 1900, Tarry verified the indicated hypothesis in this case, listing all Latin squares of order 6. The book [133] provides a proof of Euler's hypothesis for $n = 6$, and it is not based on complete enumeration.\n\nIt turned out that for $n > 6$, Euler's hypothesis is incorrect. In 1959, Parker found two orthogonal Latin squares of order 10, and a year later his construction was generalized, and a pair of Latin squares of order $n$ was constructed for all $n \\equiv 2 (\\text{mod } 4)$, except, of course, $n = 2$ and $n = 6$.\n\nAlmost nothing is known about three pairwise orthogonal Latin squares. The first unresolved case is $n = 10$.\n\n**Problem 5-21.** a) Answer: 4 or 6 lessons.\n\nIt follows from the condition that the members of the club go to the cafe either in pairs or in threes.\n\nIf they went in pairs every time, then there were 6 lessons. Indeed, if we number the participants with numbers from 1 to 4, then they could only go to the cafe in the following combinations: (1 2), (1 3), (1 4), (2 3), (2 4), (3 4).\n\nIf, however, there was at least one visit to the cafe in threes, then, in addition to it, there were only three visits: each of these three could only go to the cafe with the fourth one.\n\nb) Answer: there can be schedules of two types: (1 2 3 4 5 6), (1 7), (2 7), (3 7), (4 7), (5 7), (6 7) or (1 2 3), (1 4 7), (1 5 6), (2 5 7), (2 4 6), (3 6 7), (3 4 5).\n\nThese situations can be depicted graphically. Figure 76, a shows the first schedule: the horizontal line corresponds to the first visit to the cafe, and the lines connecting point 7 with other points correspond to the rest of the visits.\n\n![Fig. 76](illustrations/fig76.png)\n\nThe second of the given schedules is illustrated by Figure 76, b. Each line in this figure shows one visit; the numbers of the points through which it passes show the composition of the students who visited the cafe this time.\n\n∇ The following general questions are related to this problem.\n\nLet $m$ different subsets, different from $E$ itself, be distinguished in the set $E$ of $n$ elements, so that for any two elements from $E$ there is exactly one of the selected subsets containing both of these elements.\n\nCan it be that $m < n$? When is equality $m = n$ possible? (See [84], ch. III, § 5, exercise. 12.)\n\nFor connoisseurs. Let's prove that always $m \\ge n$. Let's number all the selected subsets: $A_1$, $A_2$, ..., $A_m$ and the elements of the set $E$: $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, ..., $a_n$.\n\nWe assign an $m$-dimensional vector $a_i = (\\lambda_{i1}, \\lambda_{i2}, ..., \\lambda_{im})$ to each element $a_i$ in the following way: $\\lambda_{ij} = 0$ if the element $a_i$ is not included in the set $A_j$; $\\lambda_{ij} = 1$ if this element is included in $A_j$.\n\nIt follows from the condition that the scalar product of any two such vectors is equal to 1, i.e.,  $(a_i, a_j) = 1$ for $i \\ne j$, and the scalar square of the vector is not less than 2 (since each element is included in at least 2 sets).\n\nNow suppose that $m < n$. Since the number $n$ of vectors $a_i$ is greater than the dimension of the space $m$, the system of vectors $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ is linearly dependent, i.e., the equation $x_1 a_1 + x_2 a_2 + ... + x_n a_n = 0$ has a non-zero solution. Sequentially multiplying both sides of this equation scalarly by the vectors $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$, we obtain a system of linear equations of the form\n\n$b_1 x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = 0$,\n$x_1 + b_2 x_2 + ... + x_n = 0$,\n...\n$x_1 + x_2 + ... + b_n x_n = 0$,\n\nwhere all $b_i \\ge 2$. But this system has only a zero solution (its determinant is different from zero), which contradicts our assumption. Thus, $m \\ge n$.\n\nFor the equality $m = n$ to hold, it is necessary and sufficient that one of the following two cases takes place:\n\n1) all elements of $E$, except for one, are included in one of the selected subsets, and the remaining selected subsets consist of pairs formed by this remaining element and all the others;\n\n2) the number $n$ is represented as $l(l-1) + 1$, each selected subset consists of $l$ elements, and each element of the set $E$ belongs to exactly $l$ subsets.\n\nNote that the question of when case 2) is realized is not solved. The system of subsets of the set $E$ from the generalization ∇, satisfying condition 2), has a special name: a finite projective plane of order $q = l - 1$.\n\nLet's show how to construct a finite projective plane of order $q = p^k$ (for $n = p^{2k} + p^k + 1$), where $p$ is a prime number. To do this, you need to use \"numbers\" from a finite field of order $p^k$.\n\nWe call a triple of \"numbers\" $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, considered up to proportionality (i.e., the triples $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and $(cx_1, cx_2, cx_3)$ define the same point), a point of our plane. We agree not to consider the triple $(0; 0; 0)$ as a point. A line is given by a triple of \"numbers\" $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ (except for the triple $(0; 0; 0)$), considered up to proportionality. The point $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ belongs to the line $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$ if and only if $a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0$.\n\nIt is clear that the constructed projective plane implements case 2). In this case, the points of the plane are the elements of the set $E$, the lines are the selected subsets. The number of points and the number of lines are the same, and any two points belong to only one line.\n\nFor $q = 2$, we get exactly the same example of a projective plane of order 2, which is shown in Figure 76, b.\n\nIn paragraph b) of problem 5-21, the required system of sets was constructed for the case $l = 3$, $n = 7$.\n\nMore details about finite projective planes are written, for example, in the article [132].\n\nProblem 5–21 can be reformulated in the following equivalent form.\n\nIf $n$ subsets are selected in a set $X$ of $m$ elements, any two of which have exactly one common element, then $m \\ge n$. ($X$ is the set of visits to the cafe; for each member of the club $a$, we select the set of all visits that included $a$.)\n\nThis formulation allows a natural generalization.\n\nGiven a natural number $\\lambda$ and a set $X$ of $m$ elements, in which $n$ subsets are selected, any two of which have exactly $\\lambda$ common elements. Then $m \\ge n$.\n\nProof. Let $Y$ be the set of all selected subsets of the set $X$. If $|A| = \\lambda$ for some $A \\in Y$, then $A$ must be a subset of any $B \\in Y$. If we remove $A$ from $X$ and from each $B$, we get a partition of the set $X \\setminus A$ into $n$ pairwise disjoint subsets. The number of such subsets is maximum if one of them is empty, and all the others are single-element. Since $|X \\setminus A| = m - \\lambda$, we get that\n\n$n \\le m - \\lambda + 1 \\le m$.\n\nSuppose that $|A| > \\lambda$ for each $A \\in Y$. Let $X = \\{1, 2, ..., m\\}$. Consider all possible linear polynomials \n\n$f(z_1, z_2, ..., z_m) = a_0 + a_1 z_1 + a_2 z_2 + ... + a_m z_m$\n\nwith real coefficients $a_0$, $a_1$, ..., $a_m$. They form a vector space of dimension $m + 1$. For each subset $P$ of the set $X$, we introduce $f(P) = f(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_m)$, where $\\alpha_i = 1$ if $i \\in P$, and $\\alpha_i = 0$ if $i \\notin P$. For example, $f(\\emptyset) = a_0$, $f(X) = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_m$.\n\nFor each $A \\in Y$, consider the polynomial $f_A = -\\lambda + \\sum_{i \\in A} z_i$. Then $f_A(P) = -\\lambda + |A \\cap P|$ for any subset $P$ of the set $X$. Therefore, if $A, B \\in Y$, then $f_A(B) = 0$ for $A \\ne B$ and $f_A(A) = |A| - \\lambda > 0$. This implies that the $n$ polynomials $f_A$, $A \\in Y$, are linearly independent.\n\nIndeed, if $\\sum_{A \\in Y} \\alpha_A f_A = 0$ for some real coefficients $\\alpha_A$, then $\\sum_{A \\in Y} \\alpha_A f_A (B) = 0$ for any $B \\in Y$ and, therefore, $\\alpha_B = 0$. Moreover, no linear combination of polynomials $f_A$, $A \\in Y$, is equal to 1.\n\nIndeed, if $\\sum_{A \\in Y} \\alpha_A f_A = 1$ for some real coefficients $\\alpha_A$, then $\\sum_{A \\in Y} \\alpha_A f_A (B) = 1$ for any $B \\in Y$ and, therefore, $\\sum_{A \\in Y} \\frac{\\alpha_B}{B - \\lambda} = 1$, which is impossible, since the constant term of each polynomial $f_A$ is negative, and therefore the constant term of the left-hand side of the last equality must be negative.\n\nSo, the polynomials $f_A$ and the constant polynomial 1 are linearly independent. Therefore,\n\n$n + 1 \\le m + 1 \\Rightarrow n \\le m$.\n\nWhat happens if $m = n$?\n\nIf all sets $A \\in Y$ consist of the same number of elements, then the corresponding structure is called a symmetric $(m, k, \\lambda)$-design.\n\nA projective plane of order $n$ is a symmetric $(n^2 + n + 1, n + 1, 1)$-design.\n\nExample. Let's number the vertices of the graph shown in Figure 72, c, with the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 16. If $i$ is any of these numbers, then let $A_i$ be the set consisting of the vertex $i$ and its five neighbors. Then $|A_i \\cap A_j| = 2$ for any two different $i$ and $j$, so that we get a symmetric $(16, 6, 2)$-design.\n\nIf not all sets $A \\in Y$ consist of the same number of elements, then, according to the Ryser–Woodall conjecture, all sets $A \\in Y$, except for one, consist of the same number of elements. By 2011, this conjecture has been proven for $m = p + 1$; $m = 2p + 1$; $m = 3p + 1$; $m = 4p + 1$; $m = 6p + 1$, where $p$ is a prime number, and also for $\\lambda < 60$ for any $m$.\n\nYou can learn about the current state of the theory of symmetric designs and the Ryser–Woodall conjecture from the monograph [133], which was mentioned in the solution of the previous problem 5-20.\n\n## Independent Practice Problems\n\n**5-22.** a) Is it possible to create a square table 100 × 100 of numbers so that the sum of the numbers in each column is positive, and the sum of the numbers in each row is negative?\nb) Is it possible to arrange 25 numbers in a square table of size 5 × 5 cells so that the sum of four numbers in each 2 × 2 square is negative, and the sum of all 25 numbers is positive?\n\n**5-23.** Several people watched a snail for 7 hours.
