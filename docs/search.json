    "text": "Preface to the Second Edition\nThis book is addressed to those who enjoy solving non-standard mathematical problems.\nThe specificity of distance learning and correspondence, “home” olympiads is that problems are given for an extended period. With such unhurried research work, it’s natural not only to solve a specific problem but also to find its generalizations and connections with other problems.\nThe book’s goal is to help the reader in this work. Behind disparate facts, we tried to see the contours of important mathematical concepts and constructions, to show that the generalization of relatively simple problems sometimes leads to the forefront of mathematics.\nThe first paragraph of the book contains various entertaining problems that are diverse in content and simple in formulation.\nIn each of the following five paragraphs, the problem statements are followed by their discussion: first, an elementary solution is provided, then in most cases (after the ∇ sign) a generalization is suggested, and sometimes (after the words “for experts”) there’s more difficult text using the terminology of modern mathematics. Each of these paragraphs ends with a large list of problems for independent solving; in addition to questions close to those already discussed, new research topics are also included.\nAn extensive bibliography at the end of the book indicates the main sources we used and is designed to give readers the opportunity to delve deeper into the problem that interested them.\nIn the five years since the first edition of the book, we have received many letters and reviews from mathematics enthusiasts. Some problems were used in various in-person and correspondence mathematical competitions, served as the basis for student reports at mathematical conferences; assignments were given to students of the correspondence mathematics school based on the book.\nThis experience was taken into account when revising the book. Many problems have been added, in particular, problem cycles have been compiled: solving equations in integers, divisibility of polynomials, geometric constructions, proving inequalities, sequences; new topics have also been included in the paragraph “Unusual examples and constructions”. We tried to arrange the problems for independent solving and provide hints in such a way as to help the reader repeat the main reasoning techniques.\nWe would like to express our deep gratitude to Academician I.M. Gelfand, Chairman of the Scientific Council of the All-Union Correspondence Mathematical School, for his constant attention to our work and valuable criticism. Among the mathematicians whose books and advice influenced our work, V.I. Arnold, M.I. Bashmakov, V.G. Boltyansky, N.N. Vorobyov, M.L. Gerver, P.B. Gusyatnikov, Ya.G. Sinai, D.B. Fuchs, I.M. Yaglom, G.N. Yakovlev should be named first. M.I. Zhgenti, A.V. Karzanov, E.B. Kikodze, A.K. Kovaldji, N.N. Konstantinov, S.M. Lvovsky, P.I. Masarskaya, N.E. Sokhor, A.A. Tretyakov, A.Kh. Shen, M.V.

    "text": "Preface to the Third Edition\nIt has been 25 years since the second edition of our book. During this time, it has been repeatedly used for assignments to students of the mathematical department of VZMS and S-Z MS (respectively, All-Union - then All-Russian - and North-Western correspondence schools), as well as in various competitions and in teaching schoolchildren in our country and abroad.\nIn 1998, one of the authors of the book, Nikolai Borisovich Vasiliev, an outstanding mathematician, teacher, and educator, passed away. Therefore, this edition was prepared for printing without his usually very productive participation.\nHowever, the text remained largely unchanged. The solution to one problem (11-23) has been corrected, solutions to several problems (11-1, 5-12, 5-20, 5-21, 6-10, 6-13) have been supplemented. And, of course, if something was written as “recent” in the second edition, now it had to be replaced with more precise references due to the passage of time. A thematic index has been added.\nWe would like to thank all our colleagues and friends who helped us with their advice in working on this edition. In addition to the mathematicians and educators listed in the preface to the second edition, we would like to mention R. Zigangirov, Yu.I. Ionin, A.G. Kushnirenko, L. Levin, Yu.P. Solovyev, I.F.

    "text": "2.1 Problems Discussion\nProblem 2-1. Answer: The student solved 13 problems. Let \\(x\\) be the number of correctly solved problems, and \\(y\\) be the number of incorrectly solved problems. Then \\(8x - 5y = 13\\). Rewriting this equation in the form \\[8(x + y) = 13(1 + y),\\] we see that the number \\(x + y\\) is divisible by 13. On the other hand, according to the condition, \\(x + y\\) is not greater than 20. Therefore, \\(x + y = 13\\) (in this case, \\(x = 6, y = 7\\)).\n— It is possible to solve the equation \\(8x - 5y = 13\\) in this way. One solution is immediately guessed: \\(x_0 = 1, y_0 = -1\\). For any integer \\(t\\), the pair of numbers \\(x = 1 + 5t, y = -1 + 8t\\) also satisfies this equation. Indeed, \\(8(1 + 5t) - 5(-1 + 8t) = (8 + 5) + (40t - 40t) = 13\\). Moreover, \\(x + y = 13t\\), and since \\(x + y \\le 20\\), then \\(t = 1, x + y = 13, x = 6, y = 7\\).\nFor any linear equation of the form \\(ax - by = c\\) (where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are coprime numbers), the general form of solutions in integers can be written according to the same scheme. We find some integer solution \\((x_0; y_0)\\). Then \\(x = x_0 + bt, y = y_0 + at\\), where \\(t \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), are all the solutions.\nProblem 2-2. Answer: It is not possible.\nSuppose that it is possible to take \\(k\\) one-ruble, \\(l\\) three-ruble, and \\(m\\) five-ruble bills so that the conditions of the problem are satisfied, i.e., \\(k + l + m = 10\\) and \\(k + 3l + 5m = 25\\).\nSubtracting the first equality from the second, we get: \\(2l + 4m = 15\\). But the last equality is impossible, since its left side is even, and the right side is not. Therefore, our assumption is incorrect.\n— In general, an equation of the form \\(ax - by = c\\) has a solution in integers if and only if \\(c\\) is divisible by the greatest common divisor gcd\\((a, b)\\) of the numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In problem 2-2, \\(c = 15\\) is not divisible by gcd\\((a, b) =\\) gcd\\((2, 4) = 2\\).\nProblem 2-3. Answer: into 68 parts. Divide each of the two adjacent sides of the rectangle into 68 equal parts and draw straight lines through the division points along the grid lines. Then the diagonal of the rectangle will be divided by the grid nodes into 68 equal parts, which are the diagonals of rectangles of size \\(3 \\times 4\\) mm. There are no grid nodes on the diagonal of each such rectangle.\n∇ In the general case, the diagonal of an \\(m \\times n\\) rectangle is divided by the grid nodes into gcd\\((m, n)\\) equal segments.\nProblem 2-4. a) Answer: 3 mm. Let’s perform division with remainder: \\(324 = 141 \\times 2 + 42\\) (2 squares with a side of 141 mm), \\(141 = 42 \\times 3 + 15\\) (3 squares with a side of 42 mm), \\(42 = 15 \\times 2 + 12\\) (2 squares with a side of 15 mm), \\(15 = 12 \\times 1 + 3\\) (1 square with a side of 12 mm), \\(12 = 3 \\times 4\\) (4 squares with a side of 3 mm).\n∇ For an arbitrary rectangle \\(a \\times b\\), the length of the side of the last square is equal to gcd\\((a, b)\\).\nIndeed, the procedure of successive division with remainder that we performed in the solution of the problem is the Euclidean algorithm for finding gcd\\((a, b)\\) (see [34, 88, 98]).\nThe Euclidean algorithm is based on the following fact. Let \\(a = bq + r\\), then gcd\\((a, b) =\\) gcd\\((b, r)\\). The algorithm itself can be described as follows. If we have two numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), where \\(a &gt; b &gt; 0\\), then first we divide \\(a\\) by \\(b\\) and get the remainder \\((0 \\le r &lt; b)\\). Then we divide \\(b\\) by \\(r\\) and find the remainder \\(r_2 (0 \\le r_2 &lt; r)\\). Next, we divide \\(r\\) by \\(r_2\\), and we get the remainder \\(r_3 (0 \\le r_3 &lt; r_2)\\), and so on, until some remainder \\(r_{n-1}\\) is divisible by the remainder \\(r_n\\) without a remainder, i.e., \\(r_{n+1} = 0\\). The last non-zero remainder \\(r_n\\) is gcd\\((a, b)\\). In fact, \\(r_n =\\) gcd\\((r_n, r_{n-1}) =\\) gcd\\((r_{n-1}, r_{n-2}) = ... =\\) gcd\\((r_2, r_1) =\\) gcd\\((r_1, b) =\\) gcd\\((a, b)\\).\nIn problem 2-4 a), we encountered a geometric illustration of this algorithm.\nNote also that from the sequence of quotients \\(q_1, q_2, ..., q_n\\) obtained in the process of applying the Euclidean algorithm, one can write the expansion of the fraction \\(a/b\\) into a continued fraction (see [66, 61, 119]): \\[\\frac{a}{b} = q_1 + \\frac{1}{q_2 + \\frac{1}{q_3 + ... + \\frac{1}{q_n}}}\\]\nIndeed, let’s perform division with remainder: \\(21 = 1 \\times 13 + 8\\); \\(13 = 1 \\times 8 + 5\\); \\(8 = 1 \\times 5 + 3\\); \\(5 = 1 \\times 3 + 2\\); \\(3 = 1 \\times 2 + 1\\); \\(2 = 2 \\times 1\\). Thus, we get squares with sides of 13, 8, 5, 3, 2, 1, respectively – six different sizes.\n∇ For any natural number \\(n\\), it is possible to find such numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) that the cutting will result in exactly \\(n\\) different sizes of squares.\nAs such numbers, one can take the numbers \\(F_{n+2}\\) and \\(F_{n+1}\\) of the Fibonacci sequence, which is defined as follows: \\(F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, ..., F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}\\) for \\(k \\ge 3\\).\nIf we set \\(a = F_{n+2}\\) and \\(b = F_{n+1}\\), then each time only one square with a side length of \\(F_{k-1}\\) will be cut off from the rectangle \\(F_k \\times F_{k-1}\\), and a rectangle \\(F_{k-1} \\times F_{k-2}\\) will remain.\nIn the solution of problem 2-4 b), we took \\(F_7 = 13\\) and \\(F_8 = 21\\); the sizes of the squares turned out to be equal to the first six different Fibonacci numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.\nThe constructed example of a rectangle \\(a \\times b\\) has the smallest possible (for a given \\(n\\)) dimensions; in other words, if the numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are not greater than \\(F_{n+2}\\), then the Euclidean algorithm gives gcd\\((a, b)\\) not greater than \\(n\\) in \\(n\\) steps (see [63]).\nNote also that for the ratio \\(F_{n+1}/F_n\\) of two adjacent Fibonacci numbers, the expansion into a continued fraction has an extremely simple form; it consists only of ones. For example, \\[\\frac{F_8}{F_7} = \\frac{21}{13} = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1}}}}}\\]\nProblem 2-5. a) Answer: It is possible.\nLet’s denote the operations of the machines as I, II, III, respectively, and agree to write \\(n\\) consecutive operations of I or II as \\(I^n\\) or \\(II^n\\), respectively.\nThen the card (31; 13) can be obtained from the card (19; 86) as follows:\n(19; 86) \\(\\xrightarrow{III}\\) (86; 19) \\(\\xrightarrow{I^4}\\) (10; 19) \\(\\xrightarrow{III}\\) (19; 10) \\(\\xrightarrow{I}\\) (9; 10) \\(\\xrightarrow{III}\\) (10; 9) \\(\\xrightarrow{I}\\) (1; 9) \\(\\xrightarrow{III}\\) (9; 1) \\(\\xrightarrow{I}\\) (8; 1) \\(\\xrightarrow{III}\\) (1; 8) \\(\\xrightarrow{II}\\) (9; 8) \\(\\xrightarrow{III}\\) (8; 9) \\(\\xrightarrow{II^7}\\) (22; 9) \\(\\xrightarrow{III}\\) (9; 22) \\(\\xrightarrow{II^2}\\) (31; 22) \\(\\xrightarrow{III}\\) (22; 31) \\(\\xrightarrow{II}\\) (31; 13)\nSince operations I, II, III preserve gcd(m,n), and gcd(19; 81) = 1 ≠ gcd(12; 21) = 3, it’s impossible to obtain the card (12; 21) from the card (19; 81).\n∇ The necessary and sufficient condition for obtaining a card (a, b) from a card (m, n) is that gcd(m, n) = gcd(a, b).\nThe necessity of this condition is obvious; all operations I, II, III preserve gcd.\nIf this condition is met, then both cards can be reduced to a card (d, d) using operations I and III according to the Euclidean algorithm.\nIndeed, each step of the Euclidean algorithm is division with remainder of number a by number b: \\(a = bq + r\\) \\((0 \\leq r &lt; b)\\). This step can be performed as follows:\n\\((a,b) \\xrightarrow{I^q} (r,b)\\)\nThen, after the operation \\((r,b) \\xrightarrow{III} (b,r)\\), we can similarly make the next step of the algorithm and so on until we get the card (d,d).\nGoing along the chain \\((a, b) \\rightarrow ... \\rightarrow (d, d)\\) in reverse order, replacing operation I with operation II, we will get the card (a,b) from the card (d,d).\nThus, by performing a “descent” from (m, n) to (d, d), and then an “ascent” from (d, d) to (a, b), we will ultimately go from card (m, n) to card (a, b), which was required. Problem 2-6. Answer: it can.\nFor example, the 9th blue mark and the 13th red mark are 1 cm apart from each other, because \\(13 \\cdot 25 - 9 \\cdot 36 = 1\\). In this problem, we essentially needed to find some solution in integers to one of the equations:\n\\(25x - 36y = 1\\), \\(25x - 36y = -1\\)\nor prove that such solutions do not exist.\nThere is a standard procedure by which one can always find a solution to the equation \\(ax + by = 1\\), if \\(\\gcd(a,b) = 1\\). Let’s demonstrate it on our problem. Let’s write out all the steps of the Euclidean algorithm (see discussion of problem 2-4 a)) for finding \\(\\gcd(36,25)\\):\n\\(36 = 25 \\cdot 1 + 11\\); \\(25 = 11 \\cdot 2 + 3\\); \\(11 = 3 \\cdot 3 + 2\\); \\(3 = 2 \\cdot 1 + 1\\).\nLet’s rewrite this chain of equalities as:\n\\(11 = 36 - 25 \\cdot 1\\); \\(3 = 25 - 11 \\cdot 2\\); \\(2 = 11 - 3 \\cdot 3\\); \\(1 = 3 - 2 \\cdot 1\\).\nThen we get:\n\\(1 = 3 - (11 - 3 \\cdot 3) = 3 \\cdot 4 - 11 = (25 - 11 \\cdot 2) \\cdot 4 - 11 =\\) \\(= 25 \\cdot 4 - 11 \\cdot 9 = 25 \\cdot 4 - (36 - 25) \\cdot 9 = 25 \\cdot 13 - 36 \\cdot 9\\).\nAs a result, we get the equality \\(25 \\cdot 13 - 36 \\cdot 9 = 1\\), giving one solution (13, 9) to the equation \\(25x - 36y = 1\\).\nProblem 2-7. Answer: it is possible.\nDraw any circle with the center at the vertex of the given angle. The sides of this angle cut out an arc of 19° on the circle.\nIf we consecutively mark off this arc on the circle 18 more times with a compass, then, since \\(19 \\times 19 = 361\\), the last mark will cut off an arc of 1° from the first arc. Marking off this arc 17 more times with a compass, we will divide the 19° arc into 19 equal parts. Connecting the resulting marks with the vertex of the angle, we will divide the given 19° angle into 19 equal parts.\nLet \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) be coprime natural numbers (\\(\\gcd(m,n) = 1\\)) and \\(m &lt; n\\). By marking off equal arcs on the circle consecutively one after another, each comprising \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) of the full circle, we can obtain all vertices of a regular \\(n\\)-gon inscribed in the circle in \\(n\\) steps (making \\(m\\) full rotations in the process). At some \\(x\\)-th step we will get a vertex adjacent to the initial one, at which point we will have made some number \\(y\\) of full rotations and also passed \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) of the circle, so that \\(x \\cdot \\frac{m}{n} = y + \\frac{1}{n}\\). From this we get a geometric method for solving the equation\n\\(xm - yn = 1\\)\nin integers. In our problem \\(m = 19\\), \\(n = 360\\), \\(x = 19\\), \\(y = 1\\). Problem 2-8. Answer: 4 polygonal lines.\nLet’s consider some division point as the initial one and number all division points clockwise starting from it with numbers \\(1, 2, 3, ..., 20\\).\nPolygonal lines with equal links will be obtained if we sequentially connect each point with the \\(k\\)-th one after it until we return to the initial point \\(1\\).\nFor \\(k = 1\\), we get a regular 20-gon with vertices at points \\(1, 2, 3, ..., 20\\).\nFor \\(k = 2\\), a regular 10-gon with vertices at points \\(1, 3, 5, ..., 19\\).\nFor \\(k = 3\\), a self-intersecting closed polygonal line with 20 vertices at points \\(1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18\\).\nFor \\(k = 4\\), a regular pentagon.\nFor \\(k = 5\\), a square.\nFor \\(k = 6\\), a self-intersecting closed polygonal line with 10 vertices at points \\(1, 7, 13, 19, 5, 11, 17, 3, 9, 15\\).\nFor \\(k = 7\\), again a 20-link polygonal line.\nFor \\(k = 8\\), a 5-link polygonal line (a five-pointed star).\nFor \\(k = 9\\), again a 20-link polygonal line.\nFor \\(k = 10\\), we get a degenerate 2-link polygonal line - a twice traversed segment.\nFor \\(k = 11\\), we get the same polygonal line as for \\(k = 9\\), since connecting points through 10 clockwise is the same as connecting them through 8 counterclockwise.\nSimilarly, for \\(k = 12, 13, ..., 19\\), we get the same polygonal lines as for \\(k = 8, 7, ..., 1\\) respectively.\nThus, there are a total of four different 20-link polygonal lines, they are obtained for \\(k = 1, 3, 7, 9\\).\n∇ For any \\(n\\), the number of different regular \\(n\\)-link closed polygonal lines will be equal to the number of natural numbers less than \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\) and coprime with \\(n\\).\nThe number of natural numbers less than a given number \\(n\\) and coprime with it is usually denoted by \\(\\phi(n)\\). The function \\(\\phi(n)\\) is called Euler’s function; if \\(p_1, p_2, ..., p_l\\) are all distinct prime numbers included in the factorization of the number \\(n\\) into prime factors, then ϕ(n)=n(1−1p1)(1−1p2)…(1−1pl). ϕ(n)=n(1−p1​1​)(1−p2​1​)…(1−pl​1​).\nThe answer to the generalization of problem 2-8 can be written as follows: the number of different regular \\(n\\)-link polygonal lines is equal to \\(\\frac{\\phi(n)}{2}\\). In particular, if \\(n = 20\\), then \\(\\phi(20) = 20\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 8\\), and the number of polygonal lines is equal to \\(\\frac{8}{2} = 4\\) (see [88]). Problem 2-9. a) Answer: correct. The difference of two numbers is divisible by 7 if and only if the remainders of these numbers when divided by 7 are equal. When dividing by 7, there are seven possible remainders: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Let’s assume that it’s impossible to choose 15 required numbers from 100. This means that no more than 14 numbers give a remainder of 0 when divided by 7, no more than 14 numbers give a remainder of 1, and similarly for remainders 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. But then the total number of numbers would be no more than \\(14 \\cdot 7 = 98 &lt; 100\\), and our assumption is incorrect.\n∇ The solution to problem 2-9 a) is a typical example of applying the pigeonhole principle: if \\(nk + 1\\) rabbits are in \\(n\\) cages, then at least one cage has no fewer than \\(k + 1\\) rabbits (see [43]). Indeed, if each cage had no more than \\(k\\) rabbits, then the total number of rabbits would be no more than \\(nk\\), which contradicts the condition.\nProblem 2-10. Every integer is either divisible by 3 or gives a remainder of 1 or 2 when divided by 3.\nIf a number \\(n\\) is divisible by 3, it can be written as \\(n = 3k\\), so its square can be written as \\(9k^2\\), which is clearly divisible by 3.\nIf a number \\(n\\) gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, it can be written as \\(n = 3k + 1\\), then for its square we get: \\(n^2 = 3(3k^2 + 2k) + 1\\), which shows that the square also gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\nIf a number \\(n\\) gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, similarly we get: \\(n^2 = 3(3k^2 + 4k + 1) + 1\\), i.e., in this case too, the square of the number \\(n\\) gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\nIf exactly one of two numbers is not divisible by 3, then its square when divided by 3 gives, as we have seen, a remainder of 1, so the sum of the squares of these two numbers when divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1; and if neither of the two numbers is divisible by 3, then their squares both give remainders of 1 when divided by 3, so the sum of their squares when divided by 3 will give a remainder of 2.\nThus, the sum of the squares of two integers is divisible by 3 only if each of them is divisible by 3. If a number n gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, it can be written as n = 3k + 1, then for its square we get: \\(n^2 = 3(3k^2 + 2k) + 1\\), from which it’s clear that the square when divided by 3 also gives a remainder of 1.\nIf a number n gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, we similarly get: \\(n^2 = 3(3k^2 + 4k + 1) + 1\\), i.e., in this case too, the square of the number n gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.\nIf exactly one of two numbers is not divisible by 3, then its square when divided by 3 gives, as we have seen, a remainder of 1, so the sum of the squares of these two numbers when divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1; and if neither of the two numbers is divisible by 3, then their squares both give remainders of 1 when divided by 3, so the sum of their squares when divided by 3 will give a remainder of 2.\nThus, the sum of the squares of two integers is divisible by 3 only if each of them is divisible by 3.\n∇ The transition from integers to their remainders when divided by a fixed number m is the main technique in problems on the divisibility of integers. The following simple rule is constantly used: to find the remainder of the division by m of the sum or product of two (or several) integers, it is sufficient to perform the same operations with the remainders and find what remainder the result gives when divided by m.\nLet’s show, for example, that the statement of problem 2-10 remains true if we replace the number 3 in its condition with the number 7. By squaring the numbers from 0 to 6, we can see that the remainders given by the squares of integers when divided by 7 are only 0, 1, 2, and 4. Since no two of these four numbers, except for a pair of zeros, sum to a number divisible by 7, the sum of the squares of two integers is divisible by 7 only if each number is divisible by 7.\nFor experts. The question of whether, for a given prime number p, the sum of squares of two integers \\(x^2 + y^2\\) can be divisible by p if neither of them is divisible by p, is equivalent to this: is (-1) a quadratic residue modulo p, i.e., does there exist such z that \\(1 + z^2\\) is divisible by p. The answer (known since Euler): this is possible for numbers p of the form 4k + 1 (p = 5, 13, 17, 29, …) and impossible for p = 4k + 3 (p = 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, …) A generalization of this fact, allowing for any two numbers q and p to quickly decide whether q is a quadratic residue modulo p, is the quadratic reciprocity law of Gauss (see [31, 88]). Problem 2-11. Let’s show that no number of the form 9n + 4, where n is a natural number, can be represented as the sum of three cubes; since there are infinitely many numbers of this form, the statement of the problem will follow from this.\nAny integer has either the form 3l, or 3l + 1, or 3l - 1, where l is an integer. Therefore, the cube of any integer has the form either \\(27l^3\\), or\n\\(27l^3 \\pm 27l^2 + 9l \\pm 1 = 9(3l^3 \\pm 3l^2 + l) \\pm 1\\),\ni.e., it has the form either 9m or 9m ± 1.\nCombining these possibilities in all ways, we get that the sum of cubes of three integers is represented by one of the following variants: 9n; 9n ± 1; 9n ± 2; 9n ± 3, but cannot equal a number of the form 9n + 4 (and, by the way, 9n - 4).\nis divisible by p. The answer (known since Euler): this is possible for numbers p of the form 4k + 1 (p = 5, 13, 17, 29, …) and impossible for p = 4k + 3 (p = 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, …) A generalization of this fact, allowing for any two numbers q and p to quickly decide whether q is a quadratic residue modulo p, is the quadratic reciprocity law of Gauss (see [31, 88]).\n∇ In 1909, the following hypotheses of E. Waring (1770) were proved: every natural number can be represented as the sum of no more than 9 cubes of natural numbers; for each natural k, any natural number can be represented as the sum of w or fewer k-th powers of natural numbers, where w depends only on k. The first hypothesis was proved by A. Wieferich, the second by D. Hilbert (its elementary proof was obtained by Yu.V. Linnik). The smallest value of w = w(k) is unknown already for k = 4 (see [5, 118]).\nInterestingly, every natural number n can be easily represented as the sum of five cubes of integers.\nIndeed, n - n^3 is divisible by 6 for all n. Therefore, n = n^3 + 6t, where t is an integer. Hence\n\\(n = n^3 + (t+1)^3 + (t-1)^3 + (-t)^3 + (-t)^3\\).\nProblem 2-12. Since each student could sit with no more than 27 students, this could not last more than 27 months.\nLet’s show how the teacher could seat the students for 27 months.\nLet’s number the students from 1 to 28. We place the numbers from 1 to 27 on a circle at the vertices of a regular 27-gon, and number 28 at the center of this circle. We connect points 1 and 28 with a line segment. We connect the remaining points in pairs with line segments perpendicular to this segment - see Figure 10,a. We seat the students as follows: if two numbers are connected by a segment, we seat the corresponding students at the same desk.\nIn the next month, we connect points 2 and 28 with a line segment and draw perpendicular segments through the remaining points; we seat the students according to this scheme - Figure 10,b. Then we take in turn the segments 28-3, 28-4, …, 28-27 and draw segments perpendicular to each of them. Let’s note that in Figure 10a, the sum of the numbers of each pair of circle points connected by a segment is equal to 29, which gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 27, and point 1 is connected to the center point 28. This last pair is in a special position: among the numbers from 1 to 27, it’s impossible to find such a pair for number 1, other than itself, so that the sum of the numbers in this pair gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 27.\nIn Figure 10b, the situation is similar: the sums of pairs of numbers of connected points give a remainder of 4 when divided by 27, and for number 2, among the numbers from 1 to 27, there is no suitable pair other than itself; this number 2 is connected to the center 28.\nThese observations lead to the following numerical interpretation of the schedule given in problem 2-12.\nWe fix some number \\(r\\) from 1 to 27. We pair those numbers from 1 to 27 which, when summed, give a remainder \\(r\\) when divided by 27. In this case, only the number \\(x\\) will remain unpaired, which, when summed with itself, gives a remainder \\(r\\) when divided by 27. If \\(r\\) is even, then \\(x = \\frac{r}{2}\\), and if odd, then \\(x = \\frac{r+27}{2}\\). We connect this number \\(x\\) with number 28.\nFor any even number \\(n\\) of students, a schedule for \\(n-1\\) months can be similarly compiled. To do this, we need to pair those numbers from the set of all integers from 1 to \\(n-1\\) whose sum gives a remainder \\(r\\) when divided by \\(n-1\\). If \\(r\\) is even, then the number \\(\\frac{r}{2}\\) will remain unpaired, and if odd, then the number \\(\\frac{r+n-1}{2}\\); we pair this number with the remaining number \\(n\\) (see [34], [124]).\nProblem 2-13. Answer: for example, 48, 49, 50 or 548, 549, 550.\nIt can be shown that in general, for any \\(k\\), there exist \\(k\\) consecutive natural numbers, each of which is divisible by the square of an integer greater than one.\nHere it’s appropriate to use the so-called Chinese Remainder Theorem (see [88]): whatever the natural pairwise coprime numbers \\(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\) and non-negative integers \\(r_1, r_2, ..., r_n\\) (\\(r_1 &lt; a_1, r_2 &lt; a_2, ..., r_n &lt; a_n\\)), there exists such a natural number \\(m\\), which when divided by the numbers \\(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\) gives remainders \\(r_1, r_2, ..., r_n\\) respectively.\nLet \\(p_1^2, p_2^2, ..., p_n^2\\) be squares of \\(n\\) different prime numbers. Then, according to this theorem, there exists such an integer \\(m\\) that when divided by the numbers \\(p_1^2, p_2^2, ..., p_n^2\\) gives remainders \\(p_1^2 - 1, p_2^2 - 2, ..., p_n^2 - n\\) respectively. Therefore, \\(n\\) consecutive numbers \\(m+1, m+2, ..., m+n\\) will be divisible by \\(p_1^2, p_2^2, ..., p_n^2\\) respectively.\nThe example (548, 549, 550) given in the answer was selected in this way: we set \\(p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, p_3 = 5\\), find the number \\(m\\) which gives remainders 3, 7, and 22 respectively when divided by 4, 9, and 25; for example, the number \\(m = 547\\) works. This number m can be chosen as follows. We look for it in the form: m = a ⋅ 9 ⋅ 25 + 4 ⋅ b ⋅ 25 + 4 ⋅ 9 ⋅ c.\nWe need the number a ⋅ 9 ⋅ 25 to give a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, the number 4⋅b⋅25 to give a remainder of 7 when divided by 9, and the number 4⋅9⋅c to give a remainder of 22 when divided by 25. By setting a=-1, b=7, c=2, we get m=547.\nProblem 2-14. Answer: it’s possible.\nFigure 11 shows two examples of the required arrangement. This can be verified by simple counting.\n∇ The numbers written on the first circle in Figure 11a clockwise are the remainders from dividing consecutive powers 1, 2, 2², 2³, …, 2¹¹ by 13, and counterclockwise - the remainders of consecutive powers 1, 7, 7², 7³, …, 7¹¹. Naturally, for any three adjacent numbers a, b, c (and therefore for their remainders when divided by 13), the number b² - ac is divisible by 13; if three numbers a, b, c form a geometric progression, then b² = ac.\nSimilarly, in Figure 11b, the remainders from dividing by 13 consecutive powers 1, 6, 6², …, 6¹¹ (clockwise) and 1, 11, 11², …, 11¹¹ (counterclockwise) are written out.\nThe numbers 2, 6, 11, 7 standing next to 1 in Figure 11 are the remainders when dividing 2, 2⁵, 2⁷, 2¹¹ by 13.\nIn general, for any prime p there exists a primitive root - a number coprime with p-1 numbers from 1 to p-2 (see the comment to problem 2-8).\nIn problem 2-14, p=13, φ(p-1)=φ(12)=4, as there are 4 numbers, 1, 5, 7, 11, coprime with 12 and less than it: all primitive roots are remainders from dividing 2, 2⁵, 2⁷, 2¹¹ by 13 (see [88]). Problem 2-15. Answer: incorrect. For example, for n = 6, the number \\(n^3 + 5n - 1\\) is equal to \\(5 \\cdot 72\\).\nAn expert would immediately answer the problem’s question negatively, since, apart from constants, there are no polynomials \\(F(n)\\) with integer coefficients whose values are prime numbers for all natural \\(n\\).\nIndeed, if the constant term \\(a\\) of the polynomial is not equal to 0 or ±1, then the values of \\(F(ka)\\) for integer \\(k\\) are divisible by \\(a\\), and among them there are composite numbers.\nIf \\(a = ±1\\), then one can first “shift” the polynomial \\(F(n)\\) to \\(F(n+h) = G(n)\\) so that the constant term becomes different from ±1.\nIn problem 2-15, to find \\(n\\) for which \\(F(n) = n^3 + 5n - 1\\) is a composite number, one can proceed as follows. Let \\(n = m + 1\\); the polynomial \\(F(m+1) = (m+1)^3 + 5(m+1) - 1\\) has a constant term equal to 5, and therefore \\(F(6)\\) is divisible by 5.\nNote that in 1970, our compatriot mathematician Yu. V. Matiyasevich proved the existence of a polynomial of 21 variables with integer coefficients having the following property: the set of its positive values for integer values of the variables coincides with the set of prime numbers (see [47, 54, 100]).\nProblem 2-16. Let’s factor the given number: \\(n^5 - 5n^3 + 4n = n(n^4 - 5n^2 + 4) = n(n^2 - 1)(n^2 - 4) = (n-2)(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)\\).\nThe result is a product of five consecutive integers. One of these numbers is necessarily divisible by 5, one of three consecutive numbers is divisible by 3, and out of four consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 4 and another by 2. Therefore, the product is divisible by 120.\nAnother, combinatorial solution to this problem can be obtained if we notice that for \\(n &gt; 3\\) the number \\(\\frac{(n+2)(n+1)n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5}\\) is the binomial coefficient \\(C_{n+2}^5\\) (the number of 5-element subsets of \\((n+2)\\) elements), and this number is undoubtedly an integer.\nIn general, a polynomial \\(F(x)\\) takes integer values for all integer \\(x\\) if and only if it can be represented as a sum \\(F(x) = \\sum_k a_k C_x^k\\) with integer coefficients \\(a_k\\), where \\(C_x^k = \\frac{x(x-1)...(x-k+1)}{k!}\\). Problem 2-17. a) Answer: yes.\nIt is convenient to search for such a polynomial in the form \\(p(x) = ax(x-1) + bx + c\\).\nSubstituting \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 1\\), and \\(x = 2\\) into this identity, we obtain a convenient “triangular” system of linear equations for determining the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\\(c = 19\\) \\(b + c = 85\\) \\(2a + 2b + c = 1985\\)\nFrom which we find: \\(c = 19\\), \\(b = 66\\), \\(a = 917\\), and we get the answer: \\(p(x) = 917x^2 - 851x + 19\\).\nSimilarly, it is convenient to search for a polynomial of degree no higher than \\(n\\) that takes given values at given \\(n+1\\) points \\(c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{n+1}\\). Writing \\(p(x)\\) in the form \\(p(x) = b_0 + b_1(x-c_1) + b_2(x-c_1)(x-c_2) + \\dots + b_n(x-c_1)(x-c_2)\\dots(x-c_n)\\) and substituting \\(x = c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{n+1}\\) into this identity, we obtain a triangular linear system for determining the \\(n+1\\) unknown coefficients \\(b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_n\\).\nThe indicated method for finding a polynomial with given values is called Newton’s interpolation method.\nFor the proof, we use the following statement: if a polynomial \\(p(x) = a_0x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + a_2x^{n-2} + \\dots + a_{n-1}x + a_n\\) with integer coefficients is given, then for any integers \\(c\\) and \\(d\\), the integer \\(p(c) - p(d)\\) is divisible by \\(c-d\\).\nAccording to this statement, the number \\(p(19) - p(1) = 1985 - 85 = 1900 - 19 = 1881\\) should be divisible by \\(19 - 1 = 18\\). However, \\(1881 = 1800 + 81\\), so \\(1881/18\\) is not an integer. Since \\(p(19) - p(1) = 66\\) which is not divisible by \\(18\\), the answer follows.\nLet’s prove the validity of the stated assertion: \\(p(c) - p(d) = (a_0c^n + a_1c^{n-1} + \\dots + a_{n-1}c + a_n) - (a_0d^n + a_1d^{n-1} + \\dots + a_{n-1}d + a_n) = a_0(c^n - d^n) + a_1(c^{n-1} - d^{n-1}) + \\dots + a_{n-1}(c - d)\\).\nFor any natural \\(k\\), the formula \\(c^k - d^k = (c-d)(c^{k-1} + c^{k-2}d + \\dots + cd^{k-2} + d^{k-1})\\) holds (it is obtained from the formula for the sum of \\(k\\) terms of a geometric progression with the first term \\(c^{k-1}\\) and common ratio \\(d/c\\)). Therefore, each term in the obtained equality for \\(p(c) - p(d)\\) is divisible by \\(c-d\\), which means the entire sum is divisible by \\(c-d\\).\nSimilarly, one can show that for any polynomial \\(p(x)\\) and any number \\(d\\), the polynomial \\(p(x) - p(d)\\) is divisible by the polynomial \\(x-d\\), i.e., \\(p(x) - p(d) = (x-d)q(x)\\), where \\(q(x)\\) is some polynomial. Rewriting this identity as \\(p(x) = (x-d)q(x) + p(d)\\), we obtain the following Bézout’s theorem: the remainder of dividing the polynomial \\(p(x)\\) by the binomial \\((x-d)\\) is \\(p(d)\\).\nProblem 2-18. a) Answer: \\((x^2-x+1)(x^2+x+1)(x^4-x^2+1)\\).\nIndeed: \\(x^8 + x^4 + 1 = x^8 + 2x^4 + 1 - x^4 =  (x^4+1)^2 - (x^2)^2 = (x^4+1-x^2)(x^4+1+x^2) = (x^4-x^2+1)(x^4+x^2+1)=(x^4-x^2+1)(x^2+x+1)(x^2-x+1).\\)\nIndeed: \\(x^5+x+1 = x^5-x^2+x^2+x+1 = x^2(x^3-1)+x^2+x+1 = x^2(x-1)(x^2+x+1)+x^2+x+1= (x^2+x+1)(x^3-x^2+1)=(x^2+x+1)(x^3-x+1)\\).\nThere exist polynomials of any degree with integer coefficients that cannot be factored into a product of polynomials of lower degree with integer coefficients (for example, \\(x^n-2\\)). They are called irreducible (over the ring of integers).\nThere are algorithms that allow one to find the factorization of any polynomial into irreducible factors or show that it is irreducible itself (see [85, 117]).\nProblem 2-19. Answer: for \\(a = -2\\).\nLet the polynomials \\(f(x) = x^4 + ax^2 + 1\\) and \\(g(x) = x^3 + ax + 1\\) have a common root \\(x_0\\). Then, multiplying the second polynomial by \\(x\\) and subtracting it from the first, we obtain a polynomial having the same root, and this polynomial is \\(f(x) - xg(x) = 1 - x\\). Its only root is \\(x_0 = 1\\). The polynomials \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) have this root for \\(a = -2\\); to verify this, it is sufficient to set \\(f(1)\\) and \\(g(1)\\) equal to zero – both of these numbers are equal to \\(a + 2\\).\nIn order for the polynomials \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) to have a common root \\(x_0\\), it is necessary that both of them be divisible by the polynomial \\(x - x_0\\) (Bézout’s theorem, see problem 2-17). The greatest common divisor of two polynomials can be found using the Euclidean algorithm – just like finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. In the solution of problem 2-19, we performed one step of this algorithm – we divided the polynomial \\(f(x)\\) by \\(g(x)\\) with a remainder that turned out to be \\(1-x\\).\nIf we further divide \\(g(x)\\) by \\((x-1)\\) using long division, we get the remainder \\(a+2\\): \\(g(x) = (x-1)(x^2 + x + a + 1) + (a+2)\\). If \\(a = -2\\), the remainder is 0; if \\(a \\ne -2\\), then the polynomials do not have a common divisor of degree greater than 0.\nProblem 2-20. a) Let \\(k = a^2 + 5b^2\\) and \\(l = c^2 + 5d^2\\) be any two numbers from the set \\(M\\). Then \\(kl = (a^2 + 5b^2)(c^2 + 5d^2) = (ac - 5bd)^2 + 5(ad + bc)^2\\). (*)\nThus, \\(kl = x^2 + 5y^2\\), where \\(x = ac - 5bd\\), \\(y = ad + bc\\), i.e., the number \\(kl\\) belongs to \\(M\\).\nNote the analogy between the set \\(M\\) and the set of all natural numbers. Just as every natural number is decomposed into a product of prime numbers, any number from \\(M\\) is decomposed into a product of basic numbers. However, if a natural number is uniquely decomposed into prime factors (the fundamental theorem of arithmetic), then, according to problem 2-20 b), this is not true for numbers from the set \\(M\\).\nFor experts. The identity (*) is related to the rule of multiplication of numbers of the form \\(x + y\\sqrt{-5}\\) (see [48]): \\((a + b\\sqrt{-5})(c + d\\sqrt{-5}) = (ac - 5bd) + (ad + bc)\\sqrt{-5}\\). The question of factorization of numbers from \\(M\\) is equivalent to the question of factorization in the ring of numbers of the form \\(x + y\\sqrt{-5}\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers. Problems of factorization in rings of this type played an important role in the history of mathematics. From these problems arose a new branch of mathematics – algebraic number theory (see [82]).\nProblem 2-21. Answer: for example, \\((7^2, 13^2, 17^2)\\), \\((17^2, 25^2, 31^2)\\), \\((31^2, 41^2, 49^2)\\). A triple of squares \\(p^2, q^2, r^2\\) forms an arithmetic progression if and only if \\(p^2 + r^2 = 2q^2\\) or \\((r-q)(r+q) = (q-p)(q+p)\\). For example, for the third of the indicated triples \\((p=31, q=41, r=49)\\) we get \\((49-41)(49+41) = (41-31)(41+31) = 720\\).\nHere are the general formulas for such triples (of coprime numbers): \\(p = n^2 + 2mn - m^2\\), \\(q = m^2 + n^2\\), \\(r = m^2 + 2mn - n^2\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are arbitrary coprime numbers. If for some \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) the numbers \\(p, q, r\\) have a common divisor, then we can reduce them by it. (This happens when the numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are both odd; then the corresponding numbers \\(p, q, r\\) have a common factor of 2. As is easy to show, there can be no other common factors.)\nThat numbers of this form are suitable can be verified by substituting them into the relation \\((p-q)(p+q) = (q-r)(q+r)\\). These formulas can be arrived at in various ways; we will indicate one of them (see [122]). Let \\(p^2 + r^2 = 2q^2\\). Dividing all terms of this equation by \\(q^2\\), we get \\((p/q)^2 + (r/q)^2 = 2\\). Denoting \\(p/q\\) by \\(x\\) and \\(r/q\\) by \\(y\\), we get the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\). Thus, the problem of finding the numbers \\(p, q, r\\) reduces to solving the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\) in rational numbers \\(x, y\\).\nProblem 2-22. Answers: a) seven integer solutions: \\((0;0)\\), \\((1;0)\\), \\((-1;0)\\), \\((2;6)\\), \\((2;-6)\\), \\((3;12)\\), \\((3;-12)\\); b) four more rational solutions: \\((\\pm\\frac{7}{3}, \\pm\\frac{31}{9})\\).\nHow to find new rational solutions from existing ones can be explained geometrically. Our equation defines a certain curve in the \\(Oxy\\) coordinate plane. Let us know any two points of this curve whose coordinates \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are rational numbers. The line passing through these points intersects the curve at a third point since the equation of the curve has the third degree. The coordinates \\(x_3, y_3\\) of this third point will be rational functions of \\(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\\) with integer coefficients, i.e., also rational numbers.\nThus, starting from any two solutions \\((x_1; y_1)\\), \\((x_2; y_2)\\) of the equation in rational numbers, we obtain a new solution \\((x_3; y_3)\\) in rational numbers. Now let’s present the results of the corresponding calculations. The line passing through the given points \\((x_1; y_1)\\) and \\((x_2; y_2)\\) is given by the equation \\(y = t(x - x_1) + y_1\\), where \\(t = (y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1)\\). Substituting \\(y\\) into the equation \\(y^2 = 6(x^3 - x)\\), we obtain a third-degree equation with respect to \\(x\\), two roots \\(x_1, x_2\\) of which are known to us (since the points lie on the curve), and the third can be found by Vieta’s theorem. Thus, we have obtained formulas that allow us to find new solutions from known rational solutions of the equation \\(y^2 = 6(x^3 - x)\\). Problem 2-15. Answer: incorrect. For example, for n = 6, the number \\(n^3 + 5n - 1\\) is equal to \\(5 \\cdot 72\\).\nAn expert would immediately answer the problem’s question negatively, since, apart from constants, there are no polynomials \\(F(n)\\) with integer coefficients whose values are prime numbers for all natural \\(n\\).\nIndeed, if the constant term \\(a\\) of the polynomial is not equal to 0 or ±1, then the values of \\(F(ka)\\) for integer \\(k\\) are divisible by \\(a\\), and among them there are composite numbers.\nIf \\(a = ±1\\), then one can first “shift” the polynomial \\(F(n)\\) to \\(F(n+h) = G(n)\\) so that the constant term becomes different from ±1.\nIn problem 2-15, to find \\(n\\) for which \\(F(n) = n^3 + 5n - 1\\) is a composite number, one can proceed as follows. Let \\(n = m + 1\\); the polynomial \\(F(m+1) = (m+1)^3 + 5(m+1) - 1\\) has a constant term equal to 5, and therefore \\(F(6)\\) is divisible by 5.\nNote that in 1970, our compatriot mathematician Yu. V. Matiyasevich proved the existence of a polynomial of 21 variables with integer coefficients having the following property: the set of its positive values for integer values of the variables coincides with the set of prime numbers (see [47, 54, 100]).\nProblem 2-16. Let’s factor the given number: \\(n^5 - 5n^3 + 4n = n(n^4 - 5n^2 + 4) = n(n^2 - 1)(n^2 - 4) = (n-2)(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)\\).\nThe result is a product of five consecutive integers. One of these numbers is necessarily divisible by 5, one of three consecutive numbers is divisible by 3, and out of four consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 4 and another by 2. Therefore, the product is divisible by 120.\nAnother, combinatorial solution to this problem can be obtained if we notice that for \\(n &gt; 3\\) the number \\(\\frac{(n+2)(n+1)n(n-1)(n-2)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5}\\) is the binomial coefficient \\(C_{n+2}^5\\) (the number of 5-element subsets of \\((n+2)\\) elements), and this number is undoubtedly an integer.\nIn general, a polynomial \\(F(x)\\) takes integer values for all integer \\(x\\) if and only if it can be represented as a sum \\(F(x) = \\sum_k a_k C_x^k\\) with integer coefficients \\(a_k\\), where \\(C_x^k = \\frac{x(x-1)...(x-k+1)}{k!}\\).\nProblem 2-17. a) Answer: yes.\nIt is convenient to search for such a polynomial in the form \\(p(x) = ax(x-1) + bx + c\\).\nSubstituting \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 1\\), and \\(x = 2\\) into this identity, we obtain a convenient “triangular” system of linear equations for determining the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\\(c = 19\\) \\(b + c = 85\\) \\(2a + 2b + c = 1985\\)\nFrom which we find: \\(c = 19\\), \\(b = 66\\), \\(a = 917\\), and we get the answer: \\(p(x) = 917x^2 - 851x + 19\\).\nSimilarly, it is convenient to search for a polynomial of degree no higher than \\(n\\) that takes given values at given \\(n+1\\) points \\(c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{n+1}\\). Writing \\(p(x)\\) in the form \\(p(x) = b_0 + b_1(x-c_1) + b_2(x-c_1)(x-c_2) + \\dots + b_n(x-c_1)(x-c_2)\\dots(x-c_n)\\) and substituting \\(x = c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{n+1}\\) into this identity, we obtain a triangular linear system for determining the \\(n+1\\) unknown coefficients \\(b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_n\\).\nThe indicated method for finding a polynomial with given values is called Newton’s interpolation method.\nFor the proof, we use the following statement: if a polynomial \\(p(x) = a_0x^n + a_1x^{n-1} + a_2x^{n-2} + \\dots + a_{n-1}x + a_n\\) with integer coefficients is given, then for any integers \\(c\\) and \\(d\\), the integer \\(p(c) - p(d)\\) is divisible by \\(c-d\\).\nAccording to this statement, the number \\(p(19) - p(1) = 1985 - 85 = 1900 - 19 = 1881\\) should be divisible by \\(19 - 1 = 18\\). However, \\(1881 = 1800 + 81\\), so \\(1881/18\\) is not an integer. Since \\(p(19) - p(1) = 66\\) which is not divisible by \\(18\\), the answer follows.\nLet’s prove the validity of the stated assertion: \\(p(c) - p(d) = (a_0c^n + a_1c^{n-1} + \\dots + a_{n-1}c + a_n) - (a_0d^n + a_1d^{n-1} + \\dots + a_{n-1}d + a_n) = a_0(c^n - d^n) + a_1(c^{n-1} - d^{n-1}) + \\dots + a_{n-1}(c - d)\\).\nFor any natural \\(k\\), the formula \\(c^k - d^k = (c-d)(c^{k-1} + c^{k-2}d + \\dots + cd^{k-2} + d^{k-1})\\) holds (it is obtained from the formula for the sum of \\(k\\) terms of a geometric progression with the first term \\(c^{k-1}\\) and common ratio \\(d/c\\)). Therefore, each term in the obtained equality for \\(p(c) - p(d)\\) is divisible by \\(c-d\\), which means the entire sum is divisible by \\(c-d\\).\nSimilarly, one can show that for any polynomial \\(p(x)\\) and any number \\(d\\), the polynomial \\(p(x) - p(d)\\) is divisible by the polynomial \\(x-d\\), i.e., \\(p(x) - p(d) = (x-d)q(x)\\), where \\(q(x)\\) is some polynomial. Rewriting this identity as \\(p(x) = (x-d)q(x) + p(d)\\), we obtain the following Bézout’s theorem: the remainder of dividing the polynomial \\(p(x)\\) by the binomial \\((x-d)\\) is \\(p(d)\\).\nProblem 2-18. a) Answer: \\((x^2-x+1)(x^2+x+1)(x^4-x^2+1)\\).\nIndeed: \\(x^8 + x^4 + 1 = x^8 + 2x^4 + 1 - x^4 = (x^4+1)^2 - (x^2)^2 = (x^4+1-x^2)(x^4+1+x^2) = (x^4-x^2+1)(x^4+x^2+1)=(x^4-x^2+1)(x^2+x+1)(x^2-x+1).\\)\nIndeed: \\(x^5+x+1 = x^5-x^2+x^2+x+1 = x^2(x^3-1)+x^2+x+1 = x^2(x-1)(x^2+x+1)+x^2+x+1= (x^2+x+1)(x^3-x^2+1)=(x^2+x+1)(x^3-x+1)\\).\nThere exist polynomials of any degree with integer coefficients that cannot be factored into a product of polynomials of lower degree with integer coefficients (for example, \\(x^n-2\\)). They are called irreducible (over the ring of integers).\nThere are algorithms that allow one to find the factorization of any polynomial into irreducible factors or show that it is irreducible itself (see [85, 117]).\nProblem 2-19. Answer: for \\(a = -2\\).\nLet the polynomials \\(f(x) = x^4 + ax^2 + 1\\) and \\(g(x) = x^3 + ax + 1\\) have a common root \\(x_0\\). Then, multiplying the second polynomial by \\(x\\) and subtracting it from the first, we obtain a polynomial having the same root, and this polynomial is \\(f(x) - xg(x) = 1 - x\\).\nIts only root is \\(x_0 = 1\\). The polynomials \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) have this root for \\(a = -2\\); to verify this, it is sufficient to set \\(f(1)\\) and \\(g(1)\\) equal to zero – both of these numbers are equal to \\(a + 2\\).\nIn order for the polynomials \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\) to have a common root \\(x_0\\), it is necessary that both of them be divisible by the polynomial \\(x - x_0\\) (Bézout’s theorem, see problem 2-17). The greatest common divisor of two polynomials can be found using the Euclidean algorithm – just like finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. In the solution of problem 2-19, we performed one step of this algorithm – we divided the polynomial \\(f(x)\\) by \\(g(x)\\) with a remainder that turned out to be \\(1-x\\).\nIf we further divide \\(g(x)\\) by \\((x-1)\\) using long division, we get the remainder \\(a+2\\): \\(g(x) = (x-1)(x^2 + x + a + 1) + (a+2)\\). If \\(a = -2\\), the remainder is 0; if \\(a \\ne -2\\), then the polynomials do not have a common divisor of degree greater than 0.\nProblem 2-20. a) Let \\(k = a^2 + 5b^2\\) and \\(l = c^2 + 5d^2\\) be any two numbers from the set \\(M\\). Then \\(kl = (a^2 + 5b^2)(c^2 + 5d^2) = (ac - 5bd)^2 + 5(ad + bc)^2\\). (*)\nThus, \\(kl = x^2 + 5y^2\\), where \\(x = ac - 5bd\\), \\(y = ad + bc\\), i.e., the number \\(kl\\) belongs to \\(M\\).\nNote the analogy between the set \\(M\\) and the set of all natural numbers. Just as every natural number is decomposed into a product of prime numbers, any number from \\(M\\) is decomposed into a product of basic numbers. However, if a natural number is uniquely decomposed into prime factors (the fundamental theorem of arithmetic), then, according to problem 2-20 b), this is not true for numbers from the set \\(M\\).\nFor experts. The identity (*) is related to the rule of multiplication of numbers of the form \\(x + y\\sqrt{-5}\\) (see [48]): \\((a + b\\sqrt{-5})(c + d\\sqrt{-5}) = (ac - 5bd) + (ad + bc)\\sqrt{-5}\\). The question of factorization of numbers from \\(M\\) is equivalent to the question of factorization in the ring of numbers of the form \\(x + y\\sqrt{-5}\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are integers. Problems of factorization in rings of this type played an important role in the history of mathematics. From these problems arose a new branch of mathematics – algebraic number theory (see [82]).\nProblem 2-21. Answer: for example, \\((7^2, 13^2, 17^2)\\), \\((17^2, 25^2, 31^2)\\), \\((31^2, 41^2, 49^2)\\). A triple of squares \\(p^2, q^2, r^2\\) forms an arithmetic progression if and only if \\(p^2 + r^2 = 2q^2\\) or \\((r-q)(r+q) = (q-p)(q+p)\\). For example, for the third of the indicated triples \\((p=31, q=41, r=49)\\) we get \\((49-41)(49+41) = (41-31)(41+31) = 720\\).\nHere are the general formulas for such triples (of coprime numbers): \\(p = n^2 + 2mn - m^2\\), \\(q = m^2 + n^2\\), \\(r = m^2 + 2mn - n^2\\), where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are arbitrary coprime numbers. If for some \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) the numbers \\(p, q, r\\) have a common divisor, then we can reduce them by it. (This happens when the numbers \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are both odd; then the corresponding numbers \\(p, q, r\\) have a common factor of 2. As is easy to show, there can be no other common factors.)\nThat numbers of this form are suitable can be verified by substituting them into the relation \\((p-q)(p+q) = (q-r)(q+r)\\). These formulas can be arrived at in various ways; we will indicate one of them (see [122]). Let \\(p^2 + r^2 = 2q^2\\). Dividing all terms of this equation by \\(q^2\\), we get \\((p/q)^2 + (r/q)^2 = 2\\). Denoting \\(p/q\\) by \\(x\\) and \\(r/q\\) by \\(y\\), we get the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\). Thus, the problem of finding the numbers \\(p, q, r\\) reduces to solving the equation \\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\\) in rational numbers \\(x, y\\).\nProblem 2-22. Answers: a) seven integer solutions: \\((0;0)\\), \\((1;0)\\), \\((-1;0)\\), \\((2;6)\\), \\((2;-6)\\), \\((3;12)\\), \\((3;-12)\\); b) four more rational solutions: \\((\\pm\\frac{7}{3}, \\pm\\frac{31}{9})\\).\nHow to find new rational solutions from existing ones can be explained geometrically. Our equation defines a certain curve in the \\(Oxy\\) coordinate plane. Let us know any two points of this curve whose coordinates \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) are rational numbers. The line passing through these points intersects the curve at a third point since the equation of the curve has the third degree. The coordinates \\(x_3, y_3\\) of this third point will be rational functions of \\(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2\\) with integer coefficients, i.e., also rational numbers.\nThus, starting from any two solutions \\((x_1; y_1)\\), \\((x_2; y_2)\\) of the equation in rational numbers, we obtain a new solution \\((x_3; y_3)\\) in rational numbers. Now let’s present the results of the corresponding calculations. The line passing through the given points \\((x_1; y_1)\\) and \\((x_2; y_2)\\) is given by the equation \\(y = t(x - x_1) + y_1\\), where \\(t = (y_2 - y_1)/(x_2 - x_1)\\). Substituting \\(y\\) into the equation \\(y^2 = 6(x^3 - x)\\), we obtain a third-degree equation with respect to \\(x\\), two roots \\(x_1, x_2\\) of which are known to us (since the points lie on the curve), and the third can be found by Vieta’s theorem. Thus, we have obtained formulas that allow us to find new solutions from known rational solutions of the equation \\(y^2 = 6(x^3 - x)\\). For experts. It is natural to ask the following questions. Will we, by the indicated method (drawing lines through known rational points), obtain new rational points each time? Is the set of rational points finite or infinite? How can they all be described? How many integer points are among them?\nTo answer these questions, it is advisable to introduce an associative addition operation on the third-degree curve. It is more convenient to describe it for a curve given by the equation \\(y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\\). (3) (Any non-singular curve \\(P(x,y) = 0\\) of the third degree can be reduced to this form by some transformation of variables; moreover, if the coefficients of \\(P(x,y)\\) were integers, the problem of finding rational points on the curve \\(P(x,y) = 0\\) can be reduced to a similar problem for the curve (3) with integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\); for our curve \\(y^2 = 6(x^3 - x)\\), it is sufficient to change the variables \\(v = 6x\\), \\(u = 6y\\) - it will take the form \\(u^2 = v^3 - 36v\\)).\nConsider two points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) on the curve (3), and find the third intersection point of the line \\(AB\\) with this curve. Denote by \\(A \\oplus B\\) the point symmetric to it with respect to the \\(Ox\\) axis (Fig. 12). Then for any three points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) of the curve, the relation \\((A \\oplus B) \\oplus C = A \\oplus (B \\oplus C)\\) holds. This associativity property has an interesting geometric interpretation. If two triples of lines are drawn in the plane such that lines from different triples intersect at 9 points, then a third-degree curve containing 8 of these points must also contain the ninth. If we add a point at infinity \\(Z\\) to the curve, then the set of all its points with the operation \\(\\oplus\\) forms a commutative group (the property \\(A \\oplus B = B \\oplus A\\) is obvious). The point \\(Z\\) plays the role of zero in this group; the point \\(\\ominus A\\), opposite to the point \\(A\\), is considered to be the point symmetric to \\(A\\) with respect to the \\(Ox\\) axis. The condition that three points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\) belong to the same line has the form \\(A \\oplus B = \\ominus C\\) or \\(A \\oplus B \\oplus C = Z\\).\nRational points on the curve (3) with integer \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) also form a group with respect to the operation \\(\\oplus\\). For our curve \\(y^2 = 6(x^3 - x)\\), the addition of points is given by formulas (1), (1’), (2), namely \\((x_1; y_1) \\oplus (x_2; y_2) = (x_3; -y_3)\\); \\((x_1; y_1) \\oplus (x_1; y_1) = 2(x_1; y_1) = (x_4; y_4)\\). All the points indicated in the answer can be easily obtained from three points: \\(E(1;0)\\), \\(F(-1;0)\\), \\(G(2;6)\\). Moreover, \\(E \\oplus F\\) has coordinates \\((0;0)\\), \\(E \\oplus G = (3;12)\\), \\(F \\oplus G = (-\\frac{1}{3}; \\frac{4}{3})\\), \\(E \\oplus F \\oplus G = (-\\frac{1}{2}; -\\frac{2}{3})\\), \\(G \\oplus G = 2G = (\\frac{25}{24}; -\\frac{35}{48})\\), \\(2G \\oplus F = (-\\frac{1}{49}; \\frac{120}{49})\\), \\(2G \\oplus E = (49; 840)\\), etc. (Note that \\(2E = 2F = 2(E \\oplus F) = Z\\)).\nFinding the complete group of rational points for a specific curve (3) is a very difficult problem. It is known that this is a group with a finite number of generators (Mordell’s theorem), but it is not easy to find even the number of its generators of infinite order (i.e., the number of independent points \\(A\\) of the curve for which \\(nA \\ne Z\\) for any \\(n\\)) in a specific case. (See [122]).\nInteger points, as can be seen from our example, can appear among rational points quite unexpectedly. However, according to Thue’s theorem, there are always only a finite number of them on a non-singular curve of degree 3 (or greater).\nAnother “finiteness theorem” was a recent mathematical sensation: in 1983, a proof (by the young mathematician Faltings) of Mordell’s conjecture appeared: on a non-singular curve \\(P(x,y) = 0\\) of genus greater than 1 (the curve is assumed to be non-singular at infinity), there can be only a finite number of rational points (here \\(P(x,y)\\) is an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients). The genus of a curve \\(P(x,y)\\) is a relatively easily computable integer characteristic related to the degree \\(n\\) of the polynomial \\(P(x,y)\\). Curves of genus 0 include circles and other second-order curves, and curves of genus 1 include non-singular third-degree curves. As for non-singular curves \\(P(x,y) = 0\\) of degree \\(n &gt; 4\\), their genus, as a rule, is not less than two, and therefore they can contain only a finite number of rational points. In particular, this applies to the Fermat curve \\(x^n + y^n = 1\\) for \\(n &gt; 4\\). (For more details, see [125]).",

    "text": "1.1 Answers and Hints\nProblem 1-1. Answer: It’s possible. An approximate method is shown in Figure 1. The number of bends in the strip can be made more or less, depending on the size of the person who needs to pass through.\n∇ The solution to problem 1-1 - Figure 1 - is directly related to electronic technology.\nLet’s say (Fig. 2,a) an electric current i passes into the metal through a resistance (resistor) of value R₁, and then exits from it. How to double the resistance? The natural idea is to double its length (Fig. 2,b).\nIn electronic devices, it was necessary to multiply resistances many times, which would lead to equipment of gigantic size and weight. Therefore, miniaturization is one of the main goals of the electronics industry: after all, no one will walk around with a cell phone the size of a suitcase!\nDr. Felix Zandman (1927-2011) proposed a completely different idea, thanks to which, without increasing the size of the resistor, it’s possible to multiply the resistance many times (Fig. 2,c - compare with the figure for the solution to problem 1-1!). This brilliant idea came to him during lunch, and the drawing on the lunch napkin, materializing the idea, is now exhibited in a museum. This idea is one of the most important inventions of the 20th century in the field of electronics, as it led to the creation of miniature resistors. It and a number of other ideas allowed F. Zandman to found and successfully lead the world-famous company Vishay Intertechnology (see [123]). Problem 1-2. Answer: 2. To find the erased number, it’s sufficient to substitute x = 1 into the equation.\nProblem 1-3. If Petya can do several things simultaneously, then it’s possible; if not, then it’s impossible: the sum of the given numbers is greater than one.\nProblem 1-4. Answer: The two remaining sums are 12 and 16, and the numbers themselves are either (-1), 2, 6, and 10, or (-3/2), 5/2, 13/2, and 19/2.\nProblem 1-5. Answer: 53. Among any seven consecutive days, there is always one Sunday. Since 365 = 52 * 7 + 1, 366 = 52 * 7 + 2, in any year there are 52 sets of seven days (weeks) and a remainder of 1 or 2 days. In each set of seven, there is exactly one Sunday, and in the remainder - one or none. In total, there are no more than 53 Sundays. An example of a year when there were 53 Sundays is 1984. The same number of Sundays was in 1989, 1995, 2000.\nProblem 1-6. Answer: 9 songs. If each performer is given a candy for each song, the total number of prize candies will be divisible by three.\nProblem 1-7. Answer: Olimpiada Karpovna drank 11 cups, Sosipatra Titovna - 9 cups, Poliksena Uvarovna - 7 cups.\nProblem 1-8. Let’s denote the masses of objects by the first letters of their names: D - mass of the sofa, C - suitcase, B - carpetbag, P - painting (as well as basket and hatbox - they weighed the same), S - small dog. If the lady’s claim is unjustified, then:\nD = C + B = 2P, P &gt; S, S + B &gt; D, S + C &gt; D. Hence S &gt; C, S &gt; B, 2P = C + B &lt; 2S &lt; 2P - contradiction.\nProblem 1-9. Answer: The cyclist will arrive earlier. Since the cyclist covered a third of the way before the motorcyclist covered two-thirds, the cyclist’s speed is more than half the speed of the motorcyclist. Problem 1-10. Answer: \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(a + b)\\). Attach triangles identical to the given one to all sides of the square externally, so that their catheti form extensions of each other - see Figure 3. The catheti of these triangles form a new square whose center coincides with the center of the original one. The sought distance is equal to half the diagonal of the new square, which leads to the answer.\nProblem 1-11. Answer: He lost weight. If at the beginning of spring Oblomov weighed M kg, then by the end of the year he weighed 0.75 * 1.2 * 0.9 * 1.2M = 0.972M kg.\nProblem 1-12. Answer: 24049, 5471, 5480 couriers on the first, second, and third days respectively. The only fifth power of an integer between 35,000 and 70,000 is \\(9^5\\).\nProblem 1-13. Answer: Bobchinsky. By crossing out two equivalent statements, we don’t change the parity of the number of true statements among the remaining ones, and by crossing out two opposite statements, we change the parity.\nProblem 1-14. a) Answer: All points of the ring with inner diameter 1 m and outer diameter 3 m (in Fig. 4a, this ring is shaded). It’s clear that the grasshopper can’t get closer to the center of the room than half a meter. To show that the grasshopper can reach any point in the specified ring, we first need to show that it can reach any point along the wall.\nProblem 1-15. Answer: 16 giraffes. Figure 5 shows how to place 8 giraffes: each of them can be placed in any cell with its number. The other 8 giraffes can be placed symmetrically to the first eight.\nProblem 1-16. Answer: Vanya lied; Borya was first. If we assume that Alyosha lied, then it turns out that he was either first or last. But then either Vanya or Grisha also lied, which contradicts the condition that only one of the boys lied. Similarly, all other possibilities are considered.\nProblem 1-17. Answer: More time is required for the river journey. Let the steamboat’s speed be u and the current’s speed be v. If u ≤ v, the steamboat won’t sail upstream at all, and if u &gt; v &gt; 0, the solution reduces to proving the inequality:\n\\(\\frac{10}{u+v} + \\frac{10}{u-v} &gt; \\frac{20}{u}\\)\nProblem 1-18. Answer: 25. The 13 moments when Zhenya overtook Vitya divide the total movement time into 14 intervals, and during each interval, Zhenya was ahead of Vitya by exactly one lap. So Zhenya made 14 more laps than Vitya. Let Andrey make k more laps than Vitya. By condition, 0 &lt; k &lt; 14. Reasoning similarly, we get that Andrey overtook Vitya k - 1 times. But Andrey made 14 - k fewer laps than Zhenya, and therefore Zhenya overtook him 13 - k times. In total, there were 13 + (k - 1) + (13 - k) = 25 overtakes.\nProblem 1-19. On each of the long sides of the rectangle, mark 19 cm from the ends. We get a 35×19 rectangle with the same center as the original one, and in it we can already draw diagonals that intersect at the center (Fig. 6).\nProblem 1-20. Let there be k people in the company. Then each of them has no less than zero and no more than k - 1 acquaintances in this company. If we assume that the numbers of acquaintances for all people are different, we get a contradiction. Indeed, then one has zero acquaintances, the second has one, the third has two, and so on, finally, the last one has k - 1 acquaintances. But this means that the last one knows everyone, in particular, the first one, who wasn’t supposed to know anyone!\nProblem 1-21. Answer: 11. Let’s calculate the first few terms of the given sequence: 7; 14; 17; 20; 5; 8, 11; 5; … The five repeated, which means there will be a period consisting of three numbers: 5, 8, 11.\nProblem 1-22. Answer: Alyosha and Sasha will get grades of 4, and Lenya will get a grade of 3. Starting to write out the grade sequences for each of the boys, we find that from a certain point they repeat periodically. This is schematically shown in Fig. 7. After calculating the average values of the grades, we get the answer.\nProblem 1-23. Answer: Two and a half minutes. Let v be the speed of the stream, and t be the time in minutes that he ran back.\nThen the walking speed is \\(\\frac{3}{2}v\\), the running speed is 3v, and the distance he ran back is 3vt.\nFurther, the distance he walked for 40 seconds = \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) minutes forward from where he fished out the hat to where he met the floating stick is \\(v \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}v\\), and the distance that the stick floated until he met it is \\(v(t + \\frac{2}{3})\\).\nConsequently, we can write the equation: \\(3vt = \\frac{2}{3}v + vt + \\frac{2}{3}v\\)\nAfter canceling v, we get that \\(t = \\frac{5}{6}\\) minutes.\nNow let’s calculate the lost time. It consists of two parts, of which the first (t) is half the second (2t): how long he ran back and how long he walked forward - this is the same distance, and in total \\(3t = \\frac{15}{6} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\\) minutes.\nLet’s consider another solution method using the same notations, but based on comparing distances not in a stationary reference frame associated with the shore, but in a moving one - associated with the moving stick.\nAfter the mathematician threw the stick, he moved away from it by a distance equal to \\((3v - v) \\cdot t\\), and after he fished out the hat, he approached the stick by the same distance, equal to \\(\\frac{3}{2}v + v \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}\\). Composing the equation:\n\\((3v-v) \\cdot t = \\frac{3}{2}v + v \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}\\)\nand solving it, we get that \\(t = \\frac{5}{6} = 2.5\\) minutes.\nAlong the shore, the mathematician ran for t minutes at one speed, and then walked the same distance in the opposite direction at half the speed, so he walked back for 2t minutes, and the lost time is 3t minutes.\nIf we consider the graphs of the movement of the mathematician - OBCE, the hat - AC, and the stick - BD (see Fig. 8), we can better understand the situation described in the problem.\nAll sections of the graphs are line segments, as the movement occurred at a constant speed on each of them.\nPoint A of the graph corresponds to the moment when the mathematician threw the hat, AC is the graph of the hat’s movement. Point B corresponds to the moment when the mathematician threw the stick, BD is the graph of the stick’s movement.\nProblem 1-24. Answer: a) exists, for example 7125; b) does not exist. Let x be the digit to be crossed out, k be the number of remaining digits, y be the number remaining after crossing out. Then \\(x \\cdot 10^k + y = 58y\\), from which \\(x \\cdot 10^k = 57y\\). In the last equation, the right side contains a prime factor 19, which the left side cannot contain.\nProblem 1-25. Answer: 9 masters and 3 grandmasters. If n is the number of participants in the match, then \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) is the total number of points in this match.\nProblem 1-26. Answer: exists. An example of such a pyramid is shown in Figure 9. It is constructed as follows. Take a triangular pyramid SABC, where the lateral edge SA is perpendicular to the base plane. Its lateral faces SAC and SAB are perpendicular to the base (as planes passing through the perpendicular AS to the base). Now, let’s take arbitrary points M and N on the sides AC and AB of the base respectively. The pyramid SMNBC satisfies the condition of the problem.",

    "text": "5.1 Problems Discussion\nProblem 5-1. a), b). Answer: the train could move non-uniformly, and its average speed is not necessarily equal to 100 km/h. Let’s show this. Let’s divide the entire train travel time into 11 half-hour intervals. Let the train move exactly the same way as in the first half-hour during each odd half-hour, and cover k km during each such half-hour (0 ≤ k ≤ 100), and during each even half-hour, let it move exactly the same way as in the second half-hour, and cover (100−k) km during each even half-hour. Then, no matter how the train moves during the first two half-hours - uniformly or not - the train will cover exactly 100 km during each hour of movement.\nTo answer question b), let’s find the average speed of the train. The distance traveled by the train during all odd half-hour intervals is equal to 6k, and the distance covered during all even intervals is equal to 5(100−k). Thus, during the entire 5.5 hours of movement, the train covered 6k + 5(100 − k) = 500 + k. Therefore, its average speed is equal to \\(\\frac{500 + k}{5.5}\\) (km/h). For k ≠ 50, this speed is not equal to 100 km/h.\n∇ In our example, the train’s movement was periodic with a period T = 1 hour. It can be shown that such periodicity of the speed of movement follows from the conditions of the problem. From our reasoning, it can be seen that the average speed of the train can be any number in the interval from 1000/11 (when k = 0) to 1200/11 (when k = 100) km/h.\nProblem 5-2. Answer: it can. Here’s an example:\n2; 2; 2; 2; −9; 2; 2; 2; 2; −9; 2; 2.\nHere, the differences between the person’s income and expenses (balance) for each month of the year are written in a row (taking into account the sign). We see that the sum of any five consecutive numbers in the written chain is negative (equal to −1), and in general, for the year, the sum of all numbers is positive (equal to 2).\n∇ Generalization of this problem: n numbers are written in a row, while the sum of any k adjacent numbers is negative; can the sum of all n numbers be positive in such a situation? The answer here is: if n is a multiple of k, then this cannot be, and if n is not divisible by k, then it can. In our problem, n = 12, k = 5.\nThis statement can, in turn, also be generalized. Let m numbers be written in a row. Let’s call the sum of q consecutive numbers from this row a q-sum. Then if for natural numbers m, n, and k the inequality \\(m \\le n + k − d − 1\\) is satisfied, where \\(d = gcd(n, k)\\) is the greatest common divisor of the numbers n and k, then it is possible to write m numbers in a row so that all its n-sums have one sign, and all k-sums have another sign. Moreover, all these sums can take any pre-specified values.\nIn fact, let’s compose a system of k + n − 2d linear equations with k + n − d − 1 unknowns:\n\\(x_1 + ... + x_n = a_1,\\) \\(x_2 + ... + x_{n+1} = a_2,\\) … \\(x_{k-d} + ... + x_{k+n-d-1} = a_{k-d},\\) \\(x_1 + ... + x_k = b_1,\\) \\(x_2 + ... + x_{k+1} = b_2,\\) … \\(x_{n-d} + ... + x_{k+n-d-1} = b_{n-d}.\\)\nIt can be shown that this system is consistent: its matrix has the maximum possible rank k + n − 2d. If the numbers n and k are relatively prime (d = 1), then it has a unique solution; if d &gt; 1, then the system has d − 1 free unknowns.\nThus, for given n and k, one can find a row of n + k − d − 1 numbers that satisfy the condition. If \\(m \\le n + k − d − 1\\), then the row formed by the first m numbers of the already written row also satisfies the condition.\nLet’s now show that if \\(m \\ge n + k − d\\), then there is no such row of m numbers that all its n-sums have one sign, and all k-sums have another.\nSuppose, on the contrary, that such a row of n + k − d numbers has been found, and let n &gt; k. Let’s cross out the first k numbers. Then, in the row of the remaining n − d numbers, all k-sums still have the same sign, and all (n − k)-sums have a different sign. Since\nn − d = (n − k) + k − d,\nwe have moved from the problem with parameters n and k to the problem with smaller numbers: k and n − k. Repeating this procedure (similar to the Euclidean algorithm), we will arrive at a situation where there is a row of numbers in which all d-sums have one sign, and all ld-sums have a different sign, which is obviously impossible. (Note that by a similar procedure – descent from (n, k) to (k, n − k), similar to the Euclidean algorithm, one can also prove the consistency of the system written above.)\nFinally, it is clear that if there is no row of n + k − d numbers that satisfies the condition, then it is impossible to write a longer such row.\nProblem 5-3. Answer: it is possible. Indeed:\n\\(203 = 7 + 29 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 7 \\cdot 29 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot ... \\cdot 1.\\) 167 ones 167 ones\n∇ Let’s ask the question: which natural numbers cannot be represented simultaneously as a sum and as a product of several (the same) natural numbers?\nThe answer to this question is: prime numbers.\nThe following question related to problem 5-3 is also interesting: for which natural values of k does the equation\n\\(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k = x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot ... \\cdot x_k\\)\nhave a non-zero integer solution?\nIt turns out that for all values of \\(k\\). For example:\nfor \\(k = 1\\): \\(x_1 = 1\\); for \\(k = 2\\): \\(x_1 = x_2 = 2\\); for \\(k &gt; 2\\): \\(x_1 = x_2 = ... = x_{k-2} = 1\\), \\(x_{k-1} = 2\\), \\(x_k = k\\) (see [109], problems 186–189).\nProblem 5-4. Answer: false.\nCounterexample: 6, 10, 15, 77, 91, 143.\nFrom these six numbers, \\(2 \\cdot 3\\), \\(2 \\cdot 5\\), \\(3 \\cdot 5\\), \\(7 \\cdot 11\\), \\(7 \\cdot 13\\), \\(11 \\cdot 13\\), no three have a common prime factor, but two out of every three are included in the first or second triple and therefore are not relatively prime.\nThis is clearly seen in the diagram – see Figure 54. Each vertex of the triangle has one of the numbers, and each side has a common factor of the numbers at its ends.\n∇ If you add one more word to the condition of the problem, the statement will become true: from any six natural numbers, you can choose either three pairwise relatively prime numbers, or three numbers that pairwise have a common divisor greater than one.\nFor connoisseurs, this problem will undoubtedly remind you of this: among six people, you can always choose three pairwise acquaintances or three pairwise strangers.\nProblem 5-5. a) Answer: true.\nLet \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) be the largest and smallest of the written numbers. If there is a number between them, then the statement is true. If they are next to each other, then there are two more numbers either to the right or to the left of them. They form the desired triple of numbers either with the number \\(a\\) or with the number \\(b\\).\nFor connoisseurs. There is a general theorem on this subject: in a partially ordered set consisting of \\(mn + 1\\) elements, there will always be either a chain of length \\(m + 1\\) or \\(n + 1\\) pairwise incomparable elements (this theorem is a consequence of the well-known Dilworth’s theorem: in a partially ordered set, the minimum number of chains containing all elements of the set is equal to the maximum number of pairwise incomparable elements).\nWhen considering five numbers, they can be ordered like this. We will assume that for the numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the relation \\(a \\prec b\\) holds if \\(a\\) is less than \\(b\\) and the number \\(a\\) is to the left of the number \\(b\\) in the written row. The numbers \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) turn out to be incomparable in this sense if and only if they are in decreasing order in the written row.\nSince \\(5 = 2 \\cdot 2 + 1\\) (\\(m = n = 2\\)), it follows from the formulated theorem that from five numbers, there will always be three that go either in increasing order (chain of length \\(m + 1 = 3\\)) or in decreasing order (\\(n + 1 = 3\\) pairwise incomparable elements). If in the formulated\nLet’s give a counterexample – nine numbers: 3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7.\nLet’s prove that no four digits in this sequence are in either ascending or descending order. To do this, we divide the members of the sequence into three triples: 321, 654, 987.\nIf any two digits out of these nine are in decreasing order (the one that is smaller is further from the beginning of the sequence), then they are necessarily from the same triple. This means that you cannot choose more than three digits in decreasing order, since all these digits must be in the same triple.\nIf any two digits out of these nine are in ascending order, then they are necessarily from different triples. Since there are only three triples, you cannot choose more than three digits in ascending order.\nProblem 5-6. a) Answer: it can.\nExample – two numbers, 2 and −1: \\(2 + (-1) = 1\\); \\(2^3 + (-1)^3 = 7 &gt; 1\\).\nExample – eight numbers: two numbers, each of which is equal to 0.8, and six numbers, each of which is equal to -0.1:\n\\(2 \\cdot 0.8 + 6 \\cdot (-0.1) = 1\\); \\((0.8)^3 + 6 \\cdot (-0.1)^3 = 1.018 &gt; 1\\).\nFor connoisseurs. This idea – adding many negative numbers to positive numbers, but smaller in magnitude – helps to answer the following question: can the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n\\) converge, and the series of cubes \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n^3\\) diverge? The answer to this question is positive. Here’s an example:\nThe series\n\\(\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) + ... + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} \\right) + ...\\) (*)\nis constructed as follows: after the sum \\(\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\), we put \\(2^3 = 8\\) sums \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} \\right)\\), then \\(3^3 = 27\\) sums \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{6} \\right)\\), …, then \\(n^3\\) sums \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{2n} - \\frac{1}{2n} \\right)\\), etc.\nThe specified series converges, since the sum of \\(N\\) of its first terms, where \\(3^{1+2+3+...+n} &lt; N \\le 3^{1+2+...+n+(n+1)}\\), does not exceed the number \\(\\frac{1}{2(n+1)}\\) (it is either equal to zero or equal to \\(\\frac{1}{2(n+1)}\\)).\nThe series of cubes of the terms of the series (*) diverges, since the sum of \\(n^3\\) terms is equal to \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\), therefore the sum of the first \\(3(1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3)\\) terms is equal to \\(\\frac{3n^4}{4}\\) and, therefore, grows indefinitely.\nIt can be proved that only for functions of the form \\(f(x) = kx\\) in some neighborhood of zero, the convergence of the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n\\) implies the convergence of the series \\(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} f(a_n)\\).\nProblem 5-7. a) Answer: true.\nConsider the function \\(y = F(x) = f\\left(x + \\frac{1}{5}\\right) - f(x)\\), defined and continuous on the segment \\([0; \\frac{4}{5}]\\). We need to prove that there is a point \\(x_0\\) on this segment such that \\(F(x_0) = 0\\). By the definition of the function \\(y = F(x)\\), we have:\n\\(F(0) = f\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) - f(0)\\), (1) \\(F\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) - f\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\), (2) \\(F\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) - f\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\\), (3) \\(F\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = f\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) - f\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\), (4) \\(F\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = f(1) - f\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\). (5)\nSince \\(f(0) = f(1)\\), by adding equalities (1)–(5) term by term, we get\n\\(F(0) + F\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) + F\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) + F\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) + F\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = 0\\). (*)\nEquality (*) is possible only in two cases: either all five terms in its left-hand side are equal to zero – then the problem is solved, or among these terms there are numbers of different signs. Let \\(F(x_1)\\) and \\(F(x_2)\\) be numbers of different signs, where \\(0 \\le x_1 &lt; x_2 \\le \\frac{4}{5}\\). Then, due to the continuity of the function \\(F(x)\\), there is a number \\(x_0\\) (\\(x_1 &lt; x_0 &lt; x_2\\)) such that \\(F(x_0) = 0\\), which was required.\nFigure 55 shows the required example. Let’s explain how it is constructed.\nLet points A and B be the ends of the segment [0; 1], point C be its midpoint, and points D and E divide it into three equal parts.\nLet’s draw parallel inclined lines \\(l_1\\), \\(l_2\\), and \\(l_3\\) through points A, C, and B, and intersecting lines \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) through points D and E, such that \\(m_1 \\perp m_2\\). Denoting by \\(P_1\\), \\(P_2\\), \\(P_3\\), and \\(P_4\\) the points of intersection of the lines \\(l_1\\), \\(l_2\\), and \\(l_3\\) with the lines \\(m_1\\) and \\(m_2\\) closest to the abscissa axis, we obtain the broken line \\(AP_1DP_2CP_3EP_4B\\). Let’s show that this broken line serves as the desired example.\nFirstly, it is the graph of a continuous function \\(f(x)\\) on the segment [0; 1], and \\(f(0) = f(1) = 0\\).\nSecondly, it does not have a chord of length 2/5 parallel to the abscissa axis. Indeed, if the ends of the chord parallel to the Ox axis lie on adjacent links of the broken line, then it obviously does not exceed the segment DE, which is equal to 1/3. If the ends of the chord lie on links “through one” or “through two”, then it is not less than the segment AC, which is equal to 1/2. Since \\(\\frac{1}{3} &lt; \\frac{2}{5} &lt; \\frac{1}{2}\\), our statement is proved.\n∇ Similar to the solution of problem 5-7 a), it can be proved that for the graph of the function \\(y = f(x)\\) given in its condition, there exists a chord of length \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\), parallel to the abscissa axis (\\(n\\) is any natural number) – see [62].\nFor connoisseurs. The last statement is a special case of Levy’s theorem: if a plane continuum has a chord of length \\(a\\), then it has a chord of length \\(\\frac{1}{n} \\cdot a\\) (where \\(n\\) is an arbitrary natural number) and a chord of length \\(\\alpha\\) parallel to it (where \\(0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1\\)).\nOn the other hand, for any number \\(\\alpha\\) (\\(0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; 1\\)) that is not representable in the form \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) (where \\(n\\) is a natural number), it is possible, similarly to the solution of problem 5-7 b), to construct an example of a plane continuum that has a chord of length 1 and does not have a parallel chord of length \\(\\alpha\\) – see [99].\nNote also that for a periodic continuous function on a straight line, the situation is completely different: its graph will have a horizontal chord of any given length.\nProblem 5-8. Answer: it can.\nLet’s give an example. As the first one, we take an equilateral triangle with a side length of 1/2 cm, and as the second one – an isosceles triangle with a base of 200 m and a height of \\(10^{-7}\\) m. Its lateral side is greater than half the base, i.e., greater than 100 m, and its area is equal to \\(\\frac{10^{-5}}{2}\\) m\\(^2\\) and thus less than the area of the first triangle, which is equal to \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{16}\\) cm\\(^2\\).\nProblem 5-9. a) Answer: it can.\nLet’s give an example. Consider an isosceles triangle with a base of 800 cm and a height of 0.3 cm. Its area is equal to \\(\\frac{800 \\cdot 0.3}{2} = 120\\) cm\\(^2\\) and thus greater than 100 cm\\(^2\\). Let’s show that this triangle satisfies the condition. Indeed, its height AH, dropped on the lateral side BC (Fig. 56), is equal to twice the length of the perpendicular DK, dropped from the midpoint of the base D to the lateral side BC, and this perpendicular, in turn, is less than the inclined line BD. From this it follows that the height AH is less than 0.6 cm and, therefore, all the heights of the triangle ABC are less than 1 cm.\nSince the heights of the triangle are greater than 2 cm, its sides are also greater than 2 cm, and then its area is greater than \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2\\) (cm\\(^2\\)).\nProblem 5-10. Answer: false.\nThe counterexample is shown in Figure 57. We took three vertices A, B, and D of the quadrilateral ABCD very close to each other, and the fourth vertex C and the point O inside the quadrilateral – close to each other and far from A, B, and D.\nFor connoisseurs. Let’s pose a more general question. For what \\(k\\) is the sum of the distances from any point lying inside the quadrilateral to the vertices of the quadrilateral less than \\(kP\\) (\\(P\\) – the perimeter of the quadrilateral)? Answer: for \\(k \\ge \\frac{3}{2}\\). Let’s explain why this is so.\nFor each quadrilateral ABCD, the point for which the sum of the distances to the vertices is maximum is one of its vertices.\nIndeed, the function (on the plane) \\(M \\to AM\\), where A is a fixed point of the plane, is convex (its graph is a cone), and the sum of four convex functions\n\\(f(M) = AM + BM + CM + DM\\)\nis also convex. The largest value of a convex function on a polygon is reached at its vertex.\nLet’s now show that this largest value is less than \\(kP\\) (\\(P\\) is the perimeter of the quadrilateral). Answer: for \\(k \\ge \\frac{3}{2}\\). Let’s explain why this is so.\nFor each quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\), the point for which the sum of the distances to the vertices is maximum is one of its vertices.\nIndeed, the function (on the plane) \\(M \\to AM\\), where A is a fixed point of the plane, is convex (its graph is a cone), and the sum of four convex functions\n\\(f(M) = AM + BM + CM + DM\\)\nis also convex. The largest value of a convex function on a polygon is reached at its vertex.\nLet’s now show that this largest value is less than \\(\\frac{3}{2}P\\). Let it be achieved at vertex \\(A\\). Adding the inequalities \\(AC &lt; AB + BC\\) and \\(AC &lt; AD + DC\\) term by term, we get \\(2|AC| &lt; P\\), and even more so,\n\\(2AC &lt; P + 2(BC + CD)\\).\nAdding the sum \\(2AB + 2AD\\) to both sides of the last inequality, we obtain the required inequality\n\\(AB + AC + AD &lt; \\frac{3}{2}P\\)\n(see [24]).\nFor any \\(k &lt; \\frac{3}{2}\\) it is possible to construct a counterexample by setting \\(MA = MB = MD = CO = \\epsilon\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is a sufficiently small number (see Figure 57).\nNote also that to find the point inside a given convex quadrilateral with the smallest sum of distances to the vertices, you do not need to be a great expert: this is the point of intersection of its diagonals.\nProblem 5-11. Answer: it is possible.\nFigure 58 shows how to cut a right-angled isosceles triangle with a leg length of 7 cm into 6 pairwise different right-angled isosceles triangles.\n∇ It turns out that the following statement is true: a right-angled isosceles triangle can be cut into any number greater than 10 of pairwise unequal right-angled isosceles triangles.\nFirst, let’s show how you can cut it into any even number of parts \\(2k\\), where \\(k \\ge 3\\). We will start from a right-angled isosceles triangle \\(ABC\\) with a right angle \\(C\\). Let’s extend its legs \\(CA\\) and \\(CB\\) and draw a line \\(l\\) through the vertex \\(B\\) perpendicular to the hypotenuse – see Figure 59.\nLet’s construct a broken line \\(AB_1A_1B_2A_2B_3...B_kA_k\\), all links \\(B_iA_i\\) of which are parallel to the line \\(AB\\), and all links \\(A_iB_{i+1}\\) are parallel to the line \\(BC\\); through the last link \\(B_kA_k\\) of the broken line, we draw a line that will intersect the line \\(BC\\) at some point \\(D\\). As a result, we will arrive, as is easy to show, at a right-angled isosceles triangle \\(DCA\\), divided in the required way into \\(2k + 2\\) similar pairwise unequal right-angled isosceles triangles (a special case of this construction for \\(k = 2\\) is used in the solution of problem 5-11). In the chain of triangles \\(ABC\\), \\(BAB_1\\), \\(A_1BA_1\\), \\(A_1BB_2\\), \\(B_2AA_2\\), …, \\(A_{k-1}B_kA_k\\), each subsequent triangle is similar to the previous one with a similarity coefficient of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) (the hypotenuse of the previous triangle is equal to the leg of the next one), therefore, in the sequence of segments \\(CA\\), \\(AA_1\\), \\(A_1A_2\\), …, \\(A_{k-1}A_k\\), each subsequent one is twice as long as the previous one. From this follows a practical way of cutting a given triangle in the required way.\nLet it be required to divide a right-angled isosceles triangle with a leg \\(a\\) into \\(2k + 2\\) parts. Let’s set aside segments of length \\(\\frac{a}{2^{k-1}}\\), \\(\\frac{2a}{2^{k-1}}\\), \\(\\frac{4a}{2^{k-1}}\\), …, \\(\\frac{2^{k-1}a}{2^{k-1}}\\) sequentially from the vertex of the right angle on the leg (since \\(1 + 2 + ... + 2^{k-1} = 2^k - 1\\), this can be done); the obtained points will be the vertices \\(A_1\\), \\(A_2\\), \\(A_3\\), …, \\(A_k\\) of the broken line of the construction described above.\nSo, you can cut the triangle into \\(2k\\) parts for \\(k \\ge 3\\).\nSince the smaller of the triangles obtained in this way can again be cut into 6 parts in the way indicated above, we can cut the original triangle into \\(2k + 5l\\) parts, where \\(k\\) is any integer greater than 3, and \\(l\\) is any natural number. In our construction, the ends of the rods form two equilateral triangles, located in planes perpendicular to the line connecting their centers and rotated by a certain angle relative to each other. The rods themselves lie on pairwise intersecting lines.\n∇ The connection of rods and threads in Figure 60 is the same as that of an octahedron (it forms the graph of an octahedron – see Fig. 67 for problem 5-15). It is difficult to mathematically prove the existence of such a construction (sufficiency of the condition \\(d = l \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{k^2}{3}}\\)).\nThis connection was invented in the 1960s by the architect B. Fuller. After him, many different designs of this type appeared. When writing this book, the authors set the following task: to make a rigid spatial structure from rods and threads so that the rods do not touch each other and exactly two threads depart from each end of the rods. Such a connection was made by the architect V. Koleichuk. The connection diagram is shown in Figure 61.\nArchitect, engineer, and designer Richard Buckminster Fuller gained the most fame thanks to his constructions called “geodesic dome”. He introduced the term “tensegrity” associated with them.\nHowever, the architect Vyacheslav Koleichuk, who dealt a lot with such systems in the 90s of the last century, questioned the priority of B. Fuller. He argued that such systems were first invented by our domestic constructivist Karl Ioganson in 1921. A large number of modern studies are devoted to these systems with applications in interactive and adaptive structures.\nIn architecture, the term “tensegrity” was defined by B. Fuller as “the property of frame structures, in which whole parts loaded in tension and composite parts loaded in compression are involved, to work in such a way that each part functions with maximum efficiency and economy”.\nInterestingly, the writer and anthropologist Carlos Castaneda (with the personal permission of B. Fuller!) used the term “tensegrity” to refer to a system of breathing, movements, and body positions developed by Indian shamans who lived in ancient Mexico, aimed at forming certain properties and qualities of a person engaged in this system. Thus, tensegrity according to Castaneda is a modernized version of some movements and breathing called “magical passes”.\nThe concept of “tensegrity” is also used in the study of processes in biology (especially in cell biology) and in some other industries, for example, in studies of the structure of textile fabrics, design, research of social structures, ensemble music and geodesy.\nWe especially note the application of the mathematical basis of this concept in chemistry. At the end of the 20th century, there was a great interest in fullerenes (of course, named after B. Fuller) or buckyballs. This is the name of molecular compounds belonging to the class of allotropic forms of carbon (Allotropy – the property of the existence of the same type of chemical element in the form of two or more simple substances that differ in structure and properties. For example, graphite and diamond are allotropic forms of carbon; other forms are diamond, carbyne and graphite) and representing convex closed polyhedra composed of an even number (three-coordinated) carbon atoms (this is the principle according to which the geodesic constructions of B. Fuller are built). At first, only structures were considered, including only pentagonal and hexagonal faces. According to Euler’s theorem for polyhedra, if \\(n\\), \\(e\\), and \\(f\\) are the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron, respectively, then \\(n - e + f = 2\\). Using this theorem, it can be proved that a necessary condition for the existence of the polyhedron indicated above is the presence of exactly 12 pentagonal faces and \\(\\frac{n}{2} - 10\\) hexagonal faces. In addition to carbon atoms, atoms of other chemical elements can also be included in the composition of fullerene molecules.\nThe possibility of the existence of fullerenes was predicted in 1971 in Japan, and theoretically substantiated in 1973 in the USSR. For the discovery of fullerenes, H. Kroto, R. Smalley and R. Curl were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996. Currently, intensive study of these compounds continues.\nProblem 5-13. Answer: it is possible.\nConsider a cube \\(ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1\\) with edge \\(a\\) (Fig. 62, a) and a spatial hexagon \\(AA_1B_1C_1CD_1\\) (its vertices do not lie in the same plane). It turns out that through this hexagon (and hence through the cube) it is possible to freely stretch a cube with edge \\(a\\) without touching its sides.\nTo verify this, let’s depict in Figure 62, b the projection of the cube onto a plane perpendicular to its diagonal \\(BD_1\\). Due to the symmetry of the cube, this projection is a regular hexagon \\(A'A_1'B'C'C_1'D'\\), where \\(A'\\) is the projection of the point \\(A\\), \\(A_1'\\) is the projection of the point \\(A_1\\), etc. Thus, the contour of the hexagon \\(A'A_1'B'C'C_1'D'\\) is the projection of the spatial hexagon \\(AAB_1C_1CD_1\\), and both ends of the diagonal of the cube \\(BD_1\\) are projected to the center \\(O\\) of the regular hexagon.\nSince the sine of the angle between any edge of the cube and its diagonal is equal to \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\), the side of the regular hexagon is equal to \\(a\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\), and the radius of the circle inscribed in it is equal to \\(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\) – half the diagonal of the square with side \\(a\\). Therefore, a square with a center at point \\(O\\) and a side \\(a\\) will fit entirely in the hexagon without touching its sides, as shown in Figure 62, b.\nFrom this it follows that if you put a cube with edge \\(a\\) so that its lower face coincides with the square in Figure 62, b, and move the cube perpendicular to the plane of the hexagon, then the cube will not touch the sides of the hexagon. This means that it can also be stretched through a spatial hexagon along the diagonal \\(BD_1\\).\nThus, a through hole can be made in a wooden cube through which the same cube can be stretched – see Figure 63.\n∇ From the above reasoning, it follows that through a cube with edge \\(a\\) it is possible to stretch even a cube of slightly larger dimensions than itself, namely any cube with an edge less than \\((\\sqrt{3} - 1)a\\).\nProblem 5-14. Answer: it exists.\nFigure 64 shows an example of such a polyhedron. It is obtained as follows: on the edge \\(BD\\) of the tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\), a “notch” of two triangular faces – \\(GEH\\) and \\(GFH\\) – is made. It has 8 vertices, 6 faces, 12 edges.\n∇ In the polyhedron shown in Figure 64, two faces are hexagons with two common edges, \\(BE\\) and \\(FD\\). In a convex polyhedron, such a situation is impossible: two faces of a convex polyhedron can have no more than one common edge.\nProblem 5-15. a) Answer: it is possible. An example is shown in Figure 65.\n∇ This problem resembles the well-known problem “about houses and wells”: is it possible to draw nine non-intersecting roads on a plane that connect each of the three “houses” with each of the three “wells”? In this network of roads (as well as in problem 5-15) there are 6 vertices and 3 segments depart from each vertex (Fig. 66). However, the answer to the question “about houses and wells” is negative: such a network cannot be drawn. The reason for this fact is Euler’s theorem: let \\(n\\) be the number of vertices, \\(m\\) be the number of segments connecting some of these vertices, \\(f\\) be the number of polygons into which the plane is divided by these segments; then \\(n + f = m + 1\\) (see [92]).\nFor connoisseurs. There is a theorem (Wagner, Fáry, Stein): if a graph can be depicted on a plane without intersections, then it can be depicted on a plane so that all its edges are segments. A necessary and sufficient condition for the planarity of a graph is the Pontryagin–Kuratowski theorem: a graph can be depicted on a plane without intersections if and only if it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to a graph with six vertices of the “houses – wells” type or a complete graph with five vertices (five points, pairwise connected by edges) (see [92]).\nThe example is shown in Figure 67. It can be assumed that a wire octahedron is depicted here (Fig. 68), photographed from a point lying near the center of one of its faces.\nProblem 5-16. a) Answer: it exists. The example is shown in Figure 69.\n∇ For any even \\(n \\ge 6\\), there exists a closed broken line of \\(n\\) links that intersects each of its links exactly once. An example for \\(n = 6\\) has already been constructed, and for \\(n \\ge 8\\), Figure 70 shows the construction of part of such a broken line (the rule for constructing the rest is clear).\nSuppose that we managed to construct such a broken line. Let’s consider any point of its self-intersection. Two links intersect at it, and they do not intersect with any other links. Therefore, all links of the broken line can be divided into pairs corresponding to the points of its self-intersection. This means that there is an even number of links and there cannot be seven.\n∇ This reasoning shows that in general there is no broken line with an odd number of links that intersects each of its links exactly once.\nProblem 5-17. Answer: a) it is possible; b) it is impossible.\nLet the radius of the coins be \\(R\\). Let’s place the centers of four coins at the vertices of a rhombus with side \\(2R\\). From such rhombuses, you can type the desired patterns, joining them with extreme (located on a large diagonal) coins.\nMark on the edge of each coin the three places where it touches the three others. Let’s count the total number of marked places in two ways. On the one hand, the number of marked places is even, since these places are divided into pairs at the points of contact of the coins. On the other hand, the number of marked places is odd, since it is equal to the number of coins 25 multiplied by 3.\nThe resulting contradiction proves our statement.\n∇ It is interesting to find out for which \\(k\\) it is impossible to arrange a certain (finite) number of identical round coins on a plane so that each touches \\(k\\) of the others. It turns out that this cannot be done for \\(k &gt; 3\\). Let’s prove it.\nSuppose that identical round coins are laid out on a plane so that each of them touches \\(k\\) others. Mark the centers of all coins on the plane and consider their convex hull – the smallest convex polygon containing them. Let \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) be three consecutive vertices of it; then the angle \\(ABC\\) is less than 180°. Let the coin centered at point \\(B\\) touch the coins centered at \\(O_1\\), \\(O_2\\), …, \\(O_k\\) (the centers are numbered in the order of traversal around point \\(B\\) in one of the two possible directions). It is easily shown that each of the angles \\(O_1BO_2\\), \\(O_2BO_3\\), …, \\(O_{k-1}BO_k\\) is not less than 60°. From this it follows that the inequality \\(k \\cdot 60° \\le 180°\\) must be satisfied, which implies that \\(k \\le 3\\).\nLet’s now show how, for \\(k = 3\\), it is possible to decompose any sufficiently large even number of coins in the required way. For this, it is convenient to use blanks of two types: a “rhombus” of four coins and a “flashlight” of six coins.\nIt is easy to assemble a chain of 16 coins from four “rhombuses”. Figure 71, b shows how these “rhombuses” and “flashlights” can be folded into a closed chain containing 18 coins. Any larger even number can be represented as a sum of \\(4n + 6m\\) and assemble the corresponding chain from \\(n\\) “rhombuses” and \\(m\\) “flashlights”.\nSimilar questions about the arrangement of balls in space are interesting. In 1953, it was proved that no more than 12 identical balls can be attached to a ball in space [116].\nProblem 5-18. Answer: it can.\nLet’s assign a point to each person, and different points to different people. If two people know each other, then we connect the corresponding points with a segment. Then the problem will be reduced to the following: is there a diagram that does not have triangles, and any two points are either connected by a segment or are opposite vertices of exactly one quadrilateral?\nFigure 72, a, b shows two simplest examples of such schemes. We need to give an example of a scheme consisting of more than four points. Figure 72, c shows an example of a scheme of 16 points and 40 segments that satisfies the condition. The resulting scheme satisfies the condition of the problem. This can be verified by enumeration, which is simplified due to the symmetry of the scheme.\n∇ It is interesting that the configuration described in the solution of problem 5-18 can be described as a set of vertices, edges, and large diagonals of a four-dimensional cube.\nIt can be shown that under the conditions of problem 5-18, each person in a given company has the same number of acquaintances. Indeed, let for each person \\(A\\), \\(M_A\\) denote the set of his acquaintances, and \\(N_A\\) denote the set of people unfamiliar with \\(A\\). Then each element from \\(N_A\\) can be associated with a pair of elements from \\(M_A\\) (those with whom he is familiar). It is not difficult to prove that the correspondence between the set \\(N_A\\) and the set of all possible pairs of elements of \\(M_A\\) will be one-to-one. Therefore, if \\(M_A\\) contains \\(m_A\\) elements, then \\(N_A\\) contains \\(\\frac{1}{2}m_A(m_A - 1)\\) elements, and in total, the company will have \\(n = 1 + m_A + \\frac{1}{2}m_A(m_A - 1)\\) people. This equality holds for any person \\(A\\).\nBut the equation \\(1 + x + \\frac{1}{2}x(x-1) = n\\) has (for \\(n &gt; 1\\)) only one positive root, so the number \\(m_A\\) is the same for all \\(A\\) (see [10]).\nWe do not know the complete answer to the question of for which values of \\(n\\) such companies exist. As shown above, \\(n = 1 + \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\\), where \\(m\\) is the number of acquaintances of one person. It is not difficult to prove that such companies do not exist for \\(m = 3\\), \\(m = 4\\), and for \\(m = 4k + 3\\), where \\(k\\) is any natural number. All examples of such companies known to us are shown in Figure 72, a, b, c.\nProblem 5-19. Answer: it could.\nFigure 73 schematically shows the results of all games of the chess players’ tournament, satisfying the condition of the problem. In it, each pair of chess players\nplayed 7 games. In this case:\n– the first one won two games against the second one; – the second one won two games against the first one; – the first one won three games against the third one; – the third one won four games against the first one; – the rest of the tournament games ended in a draw.\nIn this tournament, the first chess player scored 6.5 points, the second one – 7 points, the third one – 7.5 points; at the same time, the first one won the most – 5 games, the second one lost the least – 2 games, and the third one scored the most points.\n∇ You can make a tournament table (Fig. 74): denote all the number of wins (+), losses (–), and draws (=) with letters and write down all the conditions of the problem. This will result in a system of linear inequalities with a large number of variables. The solution of problem 5-19 shows that this system has at least one solution in natural numbers. Of course, it is not unique; it is interesting to obtain a description of all solutions. For a detailed discussion of this problem, see [39, 40].\nProblem 5-20. Answer: it is possible. The filling method is shown in Figure 75, different colors are shown in this figure with different hatching.\n∇ When \\(n\\) different symbols are written in an \\(n \\times n\\) table so that all different symbols are in each row and each column, it is said that a Latin square is given. Two Latin squares \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are called orthogonal if in those cells where the \\(i\\)-th symbol is in square \\(A\\), all symbols are different in square \\(B\\) (and so for each (\\(i = 1, 2, ..., n\\)).\nOur task was to construct three pairwise orthogonal Latin squares \\(4 \\times 4\\) (one gives the color, the second – the shape of the frame, and the third – the letter).\nFor connoisseurs. To compile similar square tables (they are useful in applied problems, for example, in planning multi-purpose experiments), it is convenient to use the concept of a finite affine plane (see [42]).\nLet \\(F\\) be a finite field of \\(q\\) elements; pairs \\((x; y)\\) of elements of \\(F\\) will be called points of the finite affine plane, and sets of the form \\(\\{(x;y): ax + by + c = 0\\}\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c \\in F\\), and \\(a\\) or \\(b\\) is not equal to zero, are called lines.\nIn total, there are \\(q^2\\) points and \\(q(q + 1)\\) lines, and they are divided into \\(q + 1\\) families so that in each family there are exactly \\(q\\) lines “parallel” to each other, and \\(q + 1\\) lines pass through each point.\nFor example, one family is the lines \\(x + c = 0\\), another is \\(y + c = 0\\), the third is \\(x + y + c = 0\\), the fourth (if \\(q &gt; 2\\)) is \\(x + 2y + c = 0\\), and so on.\nLet’s assign a certain property to each of the \\(q + 1\\) families: “column number”, “row number”, “letter”, “frame shape”, etc. Let’s assign a certain row number to the points of each of the \\(q\\) lines of the first family, a certain column number to the points of each of the lines of the second family, a letter to the third, a frame shape to the fourth, and so on. Then we will get a way to find out in which cell of the table \\(q \\times q\\) to place each point \\((x; y)\\), what color to assign to it, what letter, etc. Any two non-parallel lines intersect at one point, so that for any two given properties there is exactly one cell with the desired pair of properties.\nFor \\(q = 4\\), there is a finite field of elements 0, 1, \\(a\\), \\(b\\), leading precisely to the solution of our problem. The addition and multiplication tables in this field are given below.\nIt can be shown that there are no more than \\(n - 1\\) pairwise orthogonal Latin squares of order \\(n\\). Moreover, the existence of \\(n - 1\\) such squares is equivalent to the existence of a projective plane of order \\(n\\) (see the solution of the next problem 5-21 about the projective plane). If \\(n\\) is a prime number or a power of a prime number, then a projective plane of order \\(n\\) exists. For other \\(n\\), the existence of a projective plane of order \\(n\\) is an unsolved problem.\nIn 1782, Leonhard Euler proposed the following problem.\nIs it possible to arrange 36 officers of six different ranks, taken from six different regiments, in the form of a \\(6 \\times 6\\) square so that each row and each column contains officers of each rank and from each regiment?\nIn other words, L. Euler asked if there are two orthogonal Latin squares of order 6.\nIt can be shown that if \\(n\\) does not give a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then two orthogonal squares of order \\(n\\) exist. L. Euler suggested that if \\(n\\) gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then there are no such squares.\nFor \\(n = 2\\), Euler’s hypothesis is easy to verify, so \\(n = 6\\) is the first difficult case. In 1900, Tarry verified the indicated hypothesis in this case, listing all Latin squares of order 6. The book [133] provides a proof of Euler’s hypothesis for \\(n = 6\\), and it is not based on complete enumeration.\nIt turned out that for \\(n &gt; 6\\), Euler’s hypothesis is incorrect. In 1959, Parker found two orthogonal Latin squares of order 10, and a year later his construction was generalized, and a pair of Latin squares of order \\(n\\) was constructed for all \\(n \\equiv 2 (\\text{mod } 4)\\), except, of course, \\(n = 2\\) and \\(n = 6\\).\nAlmost nothing is known about three pairwise orthogonal Latin squares. The first unresolved case is \\(n = 10\\).\nProblem 5-21. a) Answer: 4 or 6 lessons.\nIt follows from the condition that the members of the club go to the cafe either in pairs or in threes.\nIf they went in pairs every time, then there were 6 lessons. Indeed, if we number the participants with numbers from 1 to 4, then they could only go to the cafe in the following combinations: (1 2), (1 3), (1 4), (2 3), (2 4), (3 4).\nIf, however, there was at least one visit to the cafe in threes, then, in addition to it, there were only three visits: each of these three could only go to the cafe with the fourth one.\nThese situations can be depicted graphically. Figure 76, a shows the first schedule: the horizontal line corresponds to the first visit to the cafe, and the lines connecting point 7 with other points correspond to the rest of the visits.\nThe second of the given schedules is illustrated by Figure 76, b. Each line in this figure shows one visit; the numbers of the points through which it passes show the composition of the students who visited the cafe this time.\n∇ The following general questions are related to this problem.\nLet \\(m\\) different subsets, different from \\(E\\) itself, be distinguished in the set \\(E\\) of \\(n\\) elements, so that for any two elements from \\(E\\) there is exactly one of the selected subsets containing both of these elements.\nCan it be that \\(m &lt; n\\)? When is equality \\(m = n\\) possible? (See [84], ch. III, § 5, exercise. 12.)\nFor connoisseurs. Let’s prove that always \\(m \\ge n\\). Let’s number all the selected subsets: \\(A_1\\), \\(A_2\\), …, \\(A_m\\) and the elements of the set \\(E\\): \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\), \\(a_3\\), …, \\(a_n\\).\nWe assign an \\(m\\)-dimensional vector \\(a_i = (\\lambda_{i1}, \\lambda_{i2}, ..., \\lambda_{im})\\) to each element \\(a_i\\) in the following way: \\(\\lambda_{ij} = 0\\) if the element \\(a_i\\) is not included in the set \\(A_j\\); \\(\\lambda_{ij} = 1\\) if this element is included in \\(A_j\\).\nIt follows from the condition that the scalar product of any two such vectors is equal to 1, i.e., \\((a_i, a_j) = 1\\) for \\(i \\ne j\\), and the scalar square of the vector is not less than 2 (since each element is included in at least 2 sets).\nNow suppose that \\(m &lt; n\\). Since the number \\(n\\) of vectors \\(a_i\\) is greater than the dimension of the space \\(m\\), the system of vectors \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\), …, \\(a_n\\) is linearly dependent, i.e., the equation \\(x_1 a_1 + x_2 a_2 + ... + x_n a_n = 0\\) has a non-zero solution. Sequentially multiplying both sides of this equation scalarly by the vectors \\(a_1\\), \\(a_2\\), …, \\(a_n\\), we obtain a system of linear equations of the form\n\\(b_1 x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = 0\\), \\(x_1 + b_2 x_2 + ... + x_n = 0\\), … \\(x_1 + x_2 + ... + b_n x_n = 0\\),\nwhere all \\(b_i \\ge 2\\). But this system has only a zero solution (its determinant is different from zero), which contradicts our assumption. Thus, \\(m \\ge n\\).\nFor the equality \\(m = n\\) to hold, it is necessary and sufficient that one of the following two cases takes place:\nNote that the question of when case 2) is realized is not solved. The system of subsets of the set \\(E\\) from the generalization ∇, satisfying condition 2), has a special name: a finite projective plane of order \\(q = l - 1\\).\nLet’s show how to construct a finite projective plane of order \\(q = p^k\\) (for \\(n = p^{2k} + p^k + 1\\)), where \\(p\\) is a prime number. To do this, you need to use “numbers” from a finite field of order \\(p^k\\).\nWe call a triple of “numbers” \\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\\), considered up to proportionality (i.e., the triples \\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\\) and \\((cx_1, cx_2, cx_3)\\) define the same point), a point of our plane. We agree not to consider the triple \\((0; 0; 0)\\) as a point. A line is given by a triple of “numbers” \\((a_1, a_2, a_3)\\) (except for the triple \\((0; 0; 0)\\)), considered up to proportionality. The point \\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\\) belongs to the line \\((a_1, a_2, a_3)\\) if and only if \\(a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0\\).\nIt is clear that the constructed projective plane implements case 2). In this case, the points of the plane are the elements of the set \\(E\\), the lines are the selected subsets. The number of points and the number of lines are the same, and any two points belong to only one line.\nFor \\(q = 2\\), we get exactly the same example of a projective plane of order 2, which is shown in Figure 76, b.\nIn paragraph b) of problem 5-21, the required system of sets was constructed for the case \\(l = 3\\), \\(n = 7\\).\nMore details about finite projective planes are written, for example, in the article [132].\nProblem 5–21 can be reformulated in the following equivalent form.\nIf \\(n\\) subsets are selected in a set \\(X\\) of \\(m\\) elements, any two of which have exactly one common element, then \\(m \\ge n\\). (\\(X\\) is the set of visits to the cafe; for each member of the club \\(a\\), we select the set of all visits that included \\(a\\).)\nThis formulation allows a natural generalization.\nGiven a natural number \\(\\lambda\\) and a set \\(X\\) of \\(m\\) elements, in which \\(n\\) subsets are selected, any two of which have exactly \\(\\lambda\\) common elements. Then \\(m \\ge n\\).\nProof. Let \\(Y\\) be the set of all selected subsets of the set \\(X\\). If \\(|A| = \\lambda\\) for some \\(A \\in Y\\), then \\(A\\) must be a subset of any \\(B \\in Y\\). If we remove \\(A\\) from \\(X\\) and from each \\(B\\), we get a partition of the set \\(X \\setminus A\\) into \\(n\\) pairwise disjoint subsets. The number of such subsets is maximum if one of them is empty, and all the others are single-element. Since \\(|X \\setminus A| = m - \\lambda\\), we get that\n\\(n \\le m - \\lambda + 1 \\le m\\).\nSuppose that \\(|A| &gt; \\lambda\\) for each \\(A \\in Y\\). Let \\(X = \\{1, 2, ..., m\\}\\). Consider all possible linear polynomials\n\\(f(z_1, z_2, ..., z_m) = a_0 + a_1 z_1 + a_2 z_2 + ... + a_m z_m\\)\nwith real coefficients \\(a_0\\), \\(a_1\\), …, \\(a_m\\). They form a vector space of dimension \\(m + 1\\). For each subset \\(P\\) of the set \\(X\\), we introduce \\(f(P) = f(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_m)\\), where \\(\\alpha_i = 1\\) if \\(i \\in P\\), and \\(\\alpha_i = 0\\) if \\(i \\notin P\\). For example, \\(f(\\emptyset) = a_0\\), \\(f(X) = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_m\\).\nFor each \\(A \\in Y\\), consider the polynomial \\(f_A = -\\lambda + \\sum_{i \\in A} z_i\\). Then \\(f_A(P) = -\\lambda + |A \\cap P|\\) for any subset \\(P\\) of the set \\(X\\). Therefore, if \\(A, B \\in Y\\), then \\(f_A(B) = 0\\) for \\(A \\ne B\\) and \\(f_A(A) = |A| - \\lambda &gt; 0\\). This implies that the \\(n\\) polynomials \\(f_A\\), \\(A \\in Y\\), are linearly independent.\nIndeed, if \\(\\sum_{A \\in Y} \\alpha_A f_A = 0\\) for some real coefficients \\(\\alpha_A\\), then \\(\\sum_{A \\in Y} \\alpha_A f_A (B) = 0\\) for any \\(B \\in Y\\) and, therefore, \\(\\alpha_B = 0\\). Moreover, no linear combination of polynomials \\(f_A\\), \\(A \\in Y\\), is equal to 1.\nIndeed, if \\(\\sum_{A \\in Y} \\alpha_A f_A = 1\\) for some real coefficients \\(\\alpha_A\\), then \\(\\sum_{A \\in Y} \\alpha_A f_A (B) = 1\\) for any \\(B \\in Y\\) and, therefore, \\(\\sum_{A \\in Y} \\frac{\\alpha_B}{B - \\lambda} = 1\\), which is impossible, since the constant term of each polynomial \\(f_A\\) is negative, and therefore the constant term of the left-hand side of the last equality must be negative.\nSo, the polynomials \\(f_A\\) and the constant polynomial 1 are linearly independent. Therefore,\n\\(n + 1 \\le m + 1 \\Rightarrow n \\le m\\).\nWhat happens if \\(m = n\\)?\nIf all sets \\(A \\in Y\\) consist of the same number of elements, then the corresponding structure is called a symmetric \\((m, k, \\lambda)\\)-design.\nA projective plane of order \\(n\\) is a symmetric \\((n^2 + n + 1, n + 1, 1)\\)-design.\nExample. Let’s number the vertices of the graph shown in Figure 72, c, with the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 16. If \\(i\\) is any of these numbers, then let \\(A_i\\) be the set consisting of the vertex \\(i\\) and its five neighbors. Then \\(|A_i \\cap A_j| = 2\\) for any two different \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), so that we get a symmetric \\((16, 6, 2)\\)-design.\nIf not all sets \\(A \\in Y\\) consist of the same number of elements, then, according to the Ryser–Woodall conjecture, all sets \\(A \\in Y\\), except for one, consist of the same number of elements. By 2011, this conjecture has been proven for \\(m = p + 1\\); \\(m = 2p + 1\\); \\(m = 3p + 1\\); \\(m = 4p + 1\\); \\(m = 6p + 1\\), where \\(p\\) is a prime number, and also for \\(\\lambda &lt; 60\\) for any \\(m\\).\nYou can learn about the current state of the theory of symmetric designs and the Ryser–Woodall conjecture from the monograph [133], which was mentioned in the solution of the previous problem 5-20.",

    "text": "3.1 Problems Discussion\nProblem 3-1. Draw two circles of radius AB with centers at points A and B. Through the intersection points of these circles, draw a line that intersects segment AB at point C. Now draw a circle with center at point C and radius AB. This circle will intersect each of the drawn circles at two points. Finally, draw two lines through these two pairs of points - see Figure 13.\nThus, we have drawn 6 lines: three circles and three straight lines. Let’s prove that the three drawn lines divide segment AB into four equal parts.\nAs is known, the locus of points equidistant from the ends of a segment is the perpendicular bisector of that segment - a line drawn through the midpoint of the segment perpendicular to it.\nThe two intersection points of the first two constructed circles are at the same distance AB from points A and B, so the line passing through them is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB and divides it into two equal parts at point C.\nSimilarly, the intersection points of the third circle with one of the first two are at the same distance AB from both the midpoint C of segment AB and the end of this segment, so the line passing through these intersection points divides half of segment AB in half again.\nTo construct using a compass and a straightedge means to reduce the solution of the problem to performing a certain sequence of the following operations:\nI. Draw a line through two given points. II. Draw a circle of a given radius from a given center. III. Find the intersection points of: a) two lines; b) a line and a circle; c) two circles.\nIn our problem, the sequence of these operations is as follows: II, II, III c), I, III a), II, III c), III c), I, I, III a), III a). At the same time, the condition of the problem is fulfilled: the number of operations I and II is equal to six.\nTry to come up with ways to divide a segment into 3 or 5 equal parts so that the number of operations I and II is as small as possible. Figure 14 shows a way to divide a segment into 6 equal parts, in which the number of operations I and II is equal to 8.\nNow, starting from points A, B, and C, let’s find the midpoint of segment AB. Draw a circle with center C and radius CA = 2r (see Figure 15). Mark the points L and M of its intersection with the circle with center A and radius r = AB. Next, draw two circles with centers L and M and radius r = AB. These circles intersect at point A and at another point D.\nLet’s prove that D is the midpoint of segment AB. Indeed, points L and M are symmetric with respect to line AC, and point D is equidistant from points L and M, i.e., it lies on line AC. Now consider two isosceles triangles ALD and CAL. They are similar to each other because they have a common angle at the bases, A. Let’s write the proportion: AD : AL = AL : CA or AD : r = r : 2r. From this, we get that 2AD = r = AB.\nAt the beginning of the solution to problem 3-2, we doubled segment AB (constructed point C) by drawing four circles. This construction can be done more economically by drawing three circles - see Figure 16, a.\nProblem 3-2 can be generalized: to indicate a method for dividing a given segment into n equal parts using a compass. Similarly, we construct segment LC = nAB, and then, similarly, using points A, B, and C, we construct point D - see Figure 16, b. From the similarity of isosceles triangles ALD and ACL, it follows that DA * CA = r^2 (in our case, CA = nr and DA = r/n).\nThis construction is related to a transformation of the plane called inversion with respect to a circle with center A and radius r = AB. The image of a point P under this transformation is defined as the point P’ lying on the ray AP for which AP’ * AP = r^2. In problem 3-2, we actually constructed the point D, which was the image of point C under inversion.\nThe inversion transformation has a remarkable property: it transforms lines and circles back into circles and lines.\nUsing inversion, it can be shown that operations III a) and III b) (finding the intersection points of two lines and a line with a circle), which were mentioned in the commentary to the previous problem, can be performed with a single compass. From this, it can be deduced that any construction problem solvable with a compass and a straightedge can be solved with a single compass (Mascheroni’s theorem). (Of course, we cannot perform operation I - draw a line through two given points - without a straightedge. Instead, we should agree that a line is defined if two of its points are given.) (See [45, 98].)\nProblem 3-3. Suppose that triangle ABC is constructed, \\(\\angle B = 3\\angle A\\) (Figure 17). Draw segment BE from point B to line AC such that \\(\\angle ABE = \\angle BAC\\). Then triangle ABE will be isosceles: AE = BE. Triangle BCE will also be isosceles because each of the angles BEC and CBE is equal to \\(2\\angle BAC\\) (angle BEC is an external angle of triangle AEB); therefore, BC = CE = a. Consequently, AE = EB = b - a, since the entire side AC is equal to b.\nIn triangle BCE, we know the lengths of all three sides, so it can be constructed with a compass and a straightedge. After that, on the extension of side CE, we mark off segment EA = b - a with a compass. Triangle ABC is the desired one.\nIndeed, it obviously has BC = a and AC = b. Let’s prove that \\(\\angle ABC = 3\\angle BAC\\). Triangle ABE is isosceles, so \\(\\angle AEB = \\angle EAB = \\angle BAC\\). …\nThe problem has a solution when a triangle can be constructed from segments a, a, and b, i.e., when 3a &gt; b &gt; a. Under this condition, the solution is unique.\nThe text of the solution written above consists of four paragraphs. They can be titled as follows: (1) analysis, (2) construction, (3) proof, (4) investigation. Usually, solutions to construction problems are formatted this way.\nProblem 3-4. The locus of centers of circles of a given radius r tangent to a given line is a pair of lines \\(l_1\\) and \\(l_2\\) parallel to this line, passing at a distance r from it.\nLet O be the center of the given circle with radius R. Then the locus of centers of circles of radius r tangent to the given circle is: 1) two circles with radii R + r and R 2) a circle with radius R + r centered at point O and the point O itself if R = r; 3) a circle with radius R + r centered at point O if R &lt; r.\nThe center of the desired circle belongs to the intersection of these two loci. Since the intersection of two parallel lines with two circles can consist of at most 8 points, the number of solutions to problem 3-4 can range from 0 to 8 (check that all these cases are possible).\nProblem 3-4 was solved by us using the method of loci. It consists of the following. Let the point X that needs to be constructed be determined by two conditions arising from the requirements of the problem. First, the locus of points satisfying only one of the conditions is found. Then the locus of points satisfying only the second condition is found. The common points of these two sets satisfy both conditions - these are the desired points X.\nProblem 3-4 reduces to constructing the center X of the circle. We have identified two conditions: 1) X is at a distance r from the given circle and 2) X is at a distance r from the given line. Having found the loci of points satisfying each of these conditions, we determined the possible positions of point X.\nProblem 3-5. Since the desired circle must be tangent to the parallel lines \\(l\\) and \\(m\\), its center K lies on a line parallel to these lines and passing midway between them. The radius R of this circle is thus equal to half the distance between lines \\(l\\) and \\(m\\). On the other hand, the desired circle must be tangent to the given circle, which means that its center K must be at a distance R + r or R - r (if R &gt; r) from point O. Thus, point K must lie on one of the circles with center O and radii R + r and R - r. The construction can be carried out as follows. Construct a line passing midway between \\(l\\) and \\(m\\), and then construct two circles with center O and radii R + r and R - r (if R &gt; r). Point K will be one of the intersection points of the line with the circles.\nThis problem is closely related to the famous problem of Apollonius (around 200 BC): given three circles, it is required to draw a fourth circle tangent to the three given ones. It turns out that this difficult problem can be reduced to problem 3-5 using the inversion transformation.\nFor definiteness, we will assume that the given circles are located outside each other. If we increase their radii by the same value, then the center of the circle tangent to them will remain in place. Let’s increase the radii so that two of the given circles touch each other. After that, we perform an inversion of the entire plane (see the commentary to problem 3-2) with respect to some circle centered at the point of tangency of the two given circles. These circles will then transform into two parallel lines, and the third one…\nHaving solved problem 3-5 for these lines and the circle, having constructed the image of point K under the inverse inversion and having performed a “compression” of the circles, we will obtain the desired circle in Apollonius’ problem.\nProblem 3-6. Draw line OF and mark some point N on ray OA. Drop the perpendicular NK from point N to line OB. Draw a circle with center N and radius NK. Let L be one of the intersection points of this circle with ray OF. Draw a line through point F parallel to NL. The point M of intersection of this line with ray OA will be the desired one - see Figure 18.\nIndeed, the homothety with center O that maps point L to point F maps, due to the parallelism of the corresponding lines, point N to point M, point K to point P (the base of the perpendicular dropped from point M to OB). Thus, from the equality NK = NL follows the equality MF = MP.\nThe problem has two solutions (during the construction, the circle with center N and radius NK will intersect ray OA at two points).\nProblem 3-6 was solved by us using the method of similarity. It generally consists of the following. First, a figure similar to the desired one is constructed, and then it is enlarged (or reduced) in the desired ratio.\nIn problem 3-6, we first constructed the broken line KNL, for which the condition of the problem is satisfied, and then we constructed a similar broken line PMF passing through point F.\nLet’s try to apply the method of loci (see the commentary to problem 3-4) to the solution of problem 3-6. It turns out that the locus of points equidistant from a given point F and a given line OB is a parabola. coordinate system Oxy so that the Ox axis coincides with line OB and the Oy axis passes through point F. Then the points (x, y) that are equidistant from point F and line OB must satisfy the equation\n\\(|y| = \\sqrt{x^2 + (y - h)^2}\\)\nSquaring both sides, we get the equation of a parabola: \\(y = x^2/2h + h/2\\).\nThus, the desired points in problem 3-6 are the intersection points of the parabola and line OA. Of course, we cannot construct the entire parabola with a compass and a straightedge, but its intersection points with a given line, according to problem 3-6, are easy to construct.\nProblem 3-7. 1) Construct a right angle and mark off segments of length 1 on its sides from the vertex. The segment connecting their ends has length \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\nIn this problem, we showed how to construct segments \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{ab}\\) from given segments a and b. Using the theorem on parallel lines intersecting the sides of an angle, it is possible to construct a segment ab/c from given segments a, b, and c.\nBy combining these constructions, many other segments can be constructed. For example, a segment of length \\(\\sqrt{ab + cd}\\) can be constructed as follows: construct segments of length m = \\(\\sqrt{4ab}\\) and n = \\(\\sqrt{4cd}\\), and then a segment of length \\(\\sqrt{m^2 + n^2}\\).\nIt turns out that from a given segment of length 1, it is possible to construct only those segments whose lengths are expressed by rational (arithmetic) operations and repeated extraction of square roots.\nFor experts. The lengths of all such segments form a field. The solvability of problem 3-7 follows from the fact that the number \\(\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2}}\\) belongs to this field. The unsolvability of the classical problem of doubling the cube follows from the fact that the number \\(\\sqrt[3]{2}\\) does not belong to this field (see [98]).\nProblem 3-8. Mark off segments OA and OB of length 1 on the given line \\(l\\), and from the same point O, two more segments OK and OL of length 1 (points K and L lie on the same side of the line; see Figure 20). Let C be the intersection point of lines AK and BL, and H be the intersection point of lines AL and BK. Then line CH will be the desired perpendicular to line \\(l\\).\nTo prove this, we need to use two theorems: 1) if in a triangle the median drawn to the base is equal to half its length, then the angle at the vertex is a right angle; 2) in a triangle, the three altitudes intersect at one point.\nIn problem 3-8, we were talking about constructions with an unusual set of tools: a straightedge and a unit length. As you can see, with their help, it is possible to solve many standard construction problems: draw a line through a given point parallel or perpendicular to a given line, mark off a given segment on a given line, and mark off a given angle in any direction from a given ray.\nHowever, not everything that can be constructed with a compass and a straightedge can be constructed with a straightedge and a unit length. For example, it is impossible to construct, starting from a segment of length 1, a segment of length \\(\\sqrt{1 + \\sqrt{2}}\\) (compare with problem 3-7); moreover, in the general case, it is impossible to construct even a right triangle from a given leg and hypotenuse.\nIt turns out that, starting from a segment of length 1, it is possible to construct only those segments whose lengths are expressed by rational operations and extraction of square roots from sums of squares of lengths of already constructed segments (in other words, expressions for lengths must remain real for all possible changes of sign in front of all radicals, see [90]).\nProblem 3-9. Answer: 1/7. Let M, N, and P be the intersection points of the given line with sides OA, OB, and diagonal OC, respectively - see Figure 21. Let’s perform the following constructions, which will allow us to represent all the necessary ratios as ratios of segments of diagonal OC.\nDraw segments BB’ and AA’ parallel to the given line, where B’ and A’ are points on diagonal OC. Then triangles OBB’ and CAA’ are equal (they are symmetric with respect to the center of the parallelogram), so OB’ = CA’. From the equalities 3 = OB : OL = OB’ : OM, 4 = OA : OK = OA’ : OM, OC = OB’ + OA’, we get:\nOC : OM = 3 + 4 = 7.\nSimilarly, it can be shown that a line that cuts off 1/A and 1/μ parts from the sides of a parallelogram, respectively, cuts off a 1/(A + μ) part from the diagonal.\nBased on this fact, it is possible to prove an important inequality for the norm of a vector defined as follows (see [80]). Let Φ be a bounded closed set with a center of symmetry O (an interior point of Φ - see Figure 22). For each vector a = OA, let ||a|| be equal to the ratio OA/OL, where L is the intersection point of the ray OA with the boundary of the figure Φ.\nThen if Φ is convex, the “triangle inequality” holds:\n||a + b|| ≤ ||a|| + ||b||\nIn particular, if Φ is a circle of radius 1 centered at O in the Oxy plane, then \\(\\sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^2 + (y_1 + y_2)^2} ≤ \\sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2} + \\sqrt{x_2^2 + y_2^2}\\) - this is the usual triangle inequality for vectors \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\).\nProblem 3-10. It is sufficient to draw (not counting the two given) 9 lines (in Figure 23, the lines are numbered in the order of their appearance). Let’s prove that in this figure, AH = BH = AB/2.\nSegment CD can be obtained from AB by homothety with center E and with center F; under both homotheties, point H goes to G (see Figure 24).\nTherefore,\nCG/AH = EC/EA = CD/AB = FC/FB = CG/BH\nfrom which AH = BH.\nSegment CG can be obtained from segment AH by homothety with center E and from AB by homothety with center M (see Figure 25). Under both homotheties, point L goes to point K.\nSince 2AH = AB,\nCL/AK = EC/EA = CG/AH = 2CG/AB = 2CM/MB = 2CL/BK\nfrom which 2AK = BK, i.e., AK = AB/3. Similarly, it is proved that in Figure 24, BK’ = AB/3, i.e., AK = KK’ = K’B.\nWe can act in the same way further (drawing line AL and so on) to divide segment AB into n equal parts for any natural n.\nLet us also note the connection of this problem, which deals with the ratio of segments in a trapezoid, with the previous one, which studied the ratio of segments in a parallelogram (see Figure 26, a). The line passing through the vertex B’ of parallelogram A’B’C’D’ and the midpoint H’ of its side A’D’ cuts off segment A’M’ = A’C’/3 from its diagonal A’C’.\nThe line passing through point M’ and parallel to side A’B’ also cuts off 1/3 from sides B’C’ and A’D’. Figures 26, a and 26, b, as we see, are very similar. We will discuss the reason for the analogy between them in the commentary to problem 3-20.\nProblem 3-11. To solve the problem, let’s make an additional construction: draw diagonals in all quadrilaterals, as shown in Figure 27, a. Let the areas of the outermost shaded triangles in Figure 27, a be \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively. Then the area of the middle triangle is \\((x + y)/2\\). Indeed, their bases are the same, and the height of the middle triangle is equal to half the sum of the heights of the outermost triangles (this follows from the fact that the height of the middle triangle is the midline of the trapezoid whose bases are the heights - see Figure 27, b).\nThe same reasoning can be carried out for the three unshaded triangles in Figure 27, a. So, the area of the entire quadrilateral is \\(3(x + y + z + u)/2\\), and the area of the part of the quadrilateral enclosed between the lines is \\((x + y + z + u)/2\\), i.e., 3 times smaller.\nA more general statement is also true. If several lines divide each of two opposite sides of a quadrilateral into equal parts, then the areas of the quadrilaterals into which they divide the given quadrilateral form an arithmetic progression. If the other two opposite sides of the given quadrilateral are also divided into equal parts and the corresponding lines are drawn so that a grid of small cells appears inside the quadrilateral - see Figure 28 - then each segment with endpoints on opposite sides of the quadrilateral will be divided by the intersection points into equal parts, and thus the areas of the cells in each row in one and the other direction will form an arithmetic progression.\nIt is curious that all the lines drawn in the figure are tangent to some parabola - see Figure 28.\nIf we imagine that the original quadrilateral is made up of hinged rods, then when it is bent in space, the corresponding lines will still intersect - they lie on a saddle-shaped surface “woven” from two families of lines.\nProblem 3-12. Answer: if the triangle is not right-angled, then there are 7 ways; if it is right-angled, then there are 6 ways. Let the set of points \\({A, B, C, D}\\) have an axis of symmetry. Only an even number of points can lie outside the axis of symmetry, otherwise they cannot be divided into mutually symmetric pairs. Since all 4 points cannot lie on the axis (points A, B, and C do not lie on the same line), we need to consider two cases.\nThere are no points of our set on the axis. Then the axis is the perpendicular bisector of one of the sides of triangle ABC, and point D is symmetric to the vertex opposite this side. Thus, we get 3 ways to position point D - points \\(D_1, D_2, D_3\\) in Figure 29; if \\(\\angle C = 90^\\circ\\), then the perpendicular bisectors of the legs AC and BC give us the same point \\(D = D_2\\), since these perpendicular bisectors are the axes of symmetry of rectangle ACBD.\nProblem 3-13. Construct a circle with diameter AM (Figure 31). Since angles APM and AQM are right angles, points P and Q lie on this circle; \\(\\angle MAQ = \\angle QPM\\) (since these are inscribed angles subtended by the same arc). Also note that \\(\\angle PAK = \\angle QPM\\). Indeed, \\(\\angle PAK = 90^\\circ - \\angle APK\\) (AK is perpendicular to PQ) and \\(\\angle QPM = 90^\\circ - \\angle APK\\) (MP is perpendicular to AP). From this, \\(\\angle MAQ = \\angle PAK\\), which is what we needed to prove.\nThis problem was repeatedly used by D. Hilbert in his famous book “Foundations of Geometry,” in particular, to find out which construction problems can be solved using only a straightedge and a unit length (see the discussion of problem 3-8 and [90]).\nProblem 3-14. Let’s calculate the side of a regular decagon given the radius of the circumscribed circle. To do this, consider the isosceles triangle AOB, where O is the center of the regular decagon, and AB is one of its sides (see Figure 32). Then \\(\\angle AOB = 36^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle OAB = 72^\\circ\\). Draw the bisector AX of angle OAB. Since triangles OBXA and BXAB are isosceles, then AB = AX = OBX. Let OA = 1, AB = \\(x\\); from the similarity of triangles AOB and BXAB, the proportion follows:\n\\(x/(1 - x) = 1/x\\)\nSolving the resulting equation, we find its positive root \\(x = (\\sqrt{5} - 1)/2\\) (see problem 3-7). Next, draw a circle of radius 1 and successively mark off on it with a compass with a radius of \\((\\sqrt{5} - 1)/2\\) all the vertices of the regular decagon one after another. We can construct a segment of such length.\nThe number \\(x = (\\sqrt{5} - 1)/2\\) often appears in various problems. For example, \\(\\sin 18^\\circ = x/2 = (\\sqrt{5} - 1)/4\\). The number \\(\\tau = 1/x = (\\sqrt{5} + 1)/2\\) has been known since ancient times - it corresponds to the “golden ratio”: if a segment is divided in this ratio \\(\\tau\\), then the ratio of the segment to its larger part will be equal to the ratio of the larger part to the smaller one. This number also arises in connection with the Fibonacci numbers (see problems 6-11, 6-16, and 6-17).\nFor experts. The possibility of constructing a regular \\(n\\)-gon is determined by whether the number \\(\\sin(180^\\circ/n)\\) belongs to the field of numbers described in the commentary to problem 3-7. As shown by C.F. Gauss, a regular \\(n\\)-gon can be constructed if and only if \\(n = 2^k p_1 p_2 ... p_m\\), where \\(p_1, p_2, ..., p_m\\) are distinct prime numbers of the form \\(2^{2^l} + 1\\). The condition that distinguishes such numbers \\(n\\) is equivalent to the following: the value of Euler’s totient function \\(\\phi(n)\\) (see the commentary to problem 2-8) is a power of two, i.e., \\(\\phi(n) = 2^k\\). For example, \\(\\phi(10)\\), the number of integers relatively prime to 10, is equal to \\(4 = 2^2\\).\nThe origin of the condition \\(\\phi(n) = 2^k\\) can be explained approximately as follows. When constructing with a compass and a straightedge, the number of points obtained each time we find the intersection points of two circles and the intersection points of a line and a circle doubles. Therefore, as a result, we generally get \\(2^l\\) solutions. Now, let’s assume that we have found an algorithm for constructing a regular ( n )-gon. Using this algorithm, we can not only construct the regular ( n )-gon, but also any of the regular closed ( n )-sided polygons (see problem 2-8). The number of such polygons is ( ), which implies that ( (n) ) (Euler’s totient function) must be a power of two. The necessity and sufficiency of this condition are proved algebraically (see [31, 51]).\nProblem 3-15. a) Two adjacent lines pass through point A of the circle and form an angle inscribed in the circle and subtended by an arc of \\(30^\\circ\\). According to the inscribed angle theorem, this angle is measured by half the arc on which it is subtended, i.e., \\(15^\\circ\\), which proves the required statement.\nSince angles AMB and ANB are equal, points A, M, N, and B lie on the same circle.\nThe fact established in problem 3-15 b) is well explained in the language of “motions.” If a line rotates uniformly with angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) around point A of the circle, then, according to the inscribed angle theorem, its other intersection point with the circle moves uniformly along the circle with angular velocity \\(2\\omega\\).\nIf two intersecting lines \\(l_A\\) and \\(l_B\\) rotate in the plane around their two points A and B with the same angular velocity \\(\\omega\\), then the trajectory of the intersection point of these lines is a circle. Indeed, let’s construct a circle \\(\\gamma\\) passing through three points: A, B, and the point M of intersection of the lines at some point in time. On the one hand, the intersection point of line \\(l_A\\) with circle \\(\\gamma\\) moves along circle \\(\\gamma\\) uniformly with angular velocity \\(2\\omega\\), and on the other hand, the intersection point of line \\(l_B\\) with the same circle \\(\\gamma\\) moves in the same way. But since at some point in time the intersection points of lines \\(l_A\\) and \\(l_B\\) with circle \\(\\gamma\\) were at the same point of circle \\(\\gamma\\), then for all other times of rotation of the lines, the points of their intersection will be on this circle.\nFor experts. The 23 drawn lines form a grid. If we color the cells of this grid in a checkerboard pattern, we will see a family of circles passing through points A and B, and a family of hyperbolas (the picture will be more visual if we take pencils of 24 lines instead of 12 at points A and B).\nHyperbolas arise here due to the following circumstance. If lines \\(l_A\\) and \\(l_B\\) rotate around their points A and B, one with angular velocity \\(\\omega\\) and the other with angular velocity \\((-\\omega)\\) (in different directions), then their intersection point moves along a hyperbola.\nIndeed, there will be a moment in time when the lines \\(l_A\\) and \\(l_B\\) under consideration are parallel. Let’s choose a coordinate system with the origin in the middle of segment AB, and direct the Ox axis parallel to lines \\(l_A\\) and \\(l_B\\).\nLet the coordinates of point A be \\((a, b)\\), then the coordinates of point B are \\((-a, -b)\\). At time \\(t\\), the equations of the lines can be written as:\n\\(x \\sin(\\omega t) - y \\cos(\\omega t) = a \\sin(\\omega t) - b \\cos(\\omega t)\\) \\(x \\sin(\\omega t) + y \\cos(\\omega t) = -a \\sin(\\omega t) - b \\cos(\\omega t)\\)\nThe coordinates of their intersection point are \\(x = -b \\cot(\\omega t)\\), \\(y = -a \\tan(\\omega t)\\).\nTherefore, \\(xy = ab\\), i.e., the intersection points of the lines lie on a hyperbola (see [16]).\nProblem 3-16. We will reflect not the ball, but the rectangular billiard table itself from the walls. After all possible multiple reflections of the rectangle with respect to its sides (it is most convenient to do this on graph paper), we will obtain a grid of rectangles folded like an “accordion” (Fig. 34).\nNow let’s prove that a line drawn through a node O of the grid at an angle of \\(30^\\circ\\) to the wall of the billiard table does not pass through other nodes. This will imply the statement of the problem.\nIf the ball had passed through any other node, a right triangle with a 30° angle would have been formed, whose legs have integer lengths. But \\(\\tan(30°) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\) (an irrational number) cannot be equal to the ratio of two integers.\nFor experts: The trajectory of the ball in problem 3-16 will “densely sweep” the entire billiard table, although its direction will always be at an angle of 30° with one of the sides. If the billiard table has the shape of a circle or an ellipse, the trajectory of the ball will no longer be everywhere dense - there will be areas where it does not enter. In general, the behavior of a typical ball trajectory in a billiard table on a plane or in a multidimensional space strongly depends on the shape of the billiard table. For billiard tables, all sides of which are convex inward, ergodicity has been proven: a typical ball trajectory is everywhere dense in the phase space, it passes arbitrarily close to any point of the billiard table, and in various directions. It is to such problems about scattering billiards that some mathematical models of a gas of solid colliding “atoms” are reduced. Convex billiards, in particular billiards with straight walls, as a rule, do not have this property, and it was possible to describe the trajectories in such billiards only in special cases (see [110, 111]).\nProblem 3-17. a) Answer: they can.\nAn example is shown in Figure 35. b) Answer: they cannot.\nConsider three points, all pairwise distances between which are equal to 1 cm. They form an equilateral triangle with a side length of 1 cm. The distances from the fourth point to some two of them are equal to 1 cm, therefore the fourth point with these two also forms an equilateral triangle. Therefore, all four points must form a rhombus with a side length of 1 cm (see Figure 36). But then the length of the longer diagonal of this rhombus, which is equal to \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) cm, and \\(1.8 \\times \\sqrt{3}\\).\nLet’s generalize this problem as follows.\nFor what values of \\(a\\) do there exist four points: a) on the plane; b) in space, the pairwise distances between which are equal to 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, \\(a\\)?\nFrom the solution to problem 3-17, it is clear that the answer to question a) is: only for \\(a = \\sqrt{3}\\). The same solution implies the answer to question b): for \\(0 &lt; a &lt; \\sqrt{3}\\). Indeed, by bending the rhombus in space along its smaller diagonal, we see that the distance between its opposite vertices can vary from \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) to 0.\nFor experts: Let’s make one more observation: for \\(\\sqrt{3} &lt; a &lt; 2\\), the triangle inequalities (the length of the larger side does not exceed the sum of the lengths of the other two) are satisfied for any three of these four points, however, in space (and even in \\(n\\)-dimensional Euclidean space) there are no four points with such pairwise distances.\nA more general question can be posed: is it possible to arrange a) on the plane; b) in space four points 1, 2, 3, 4 so that the pairwise distances between them are equal to the given numbers \\(r_{12}\\), \\(r_{13}\\), \\(r_{14}\\), \\(r_{23}\\), \\(r_{24}\\), \\(r_{34}\\) (where \\(r_{ij}\\) is the distance between points \\(i\\) and \\(j\\))? Of course, all numbers \\(r_{ij}\\) must be non-negative and satisfy the triangle inequalities \\(r_{ij} + r_{jk} &gt; r_{ik}\\). But this is not enough.\n\\[\\Delta_4 = \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & r_{12}^2 & r_{13}^2 & r_{14}^2 & 1 \\\\ r_{12}^2 & 0 & r_{23}^2 & r_{24}^2 & 1 \\\\ r_{13}^2 & r_{23}^2 & 0 & r_{34}^2 & 1 \\\\ r_{14}^2 & r_{24}^2 & r_{34}^2 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{vmatrix}\\]\nFor an affirmative answer to question b), it is necessary and sufficient that the determinant \\(\\Delta_4\\) be non-negative, and for the possibility of placement on a plane (question a)), the determinant \\(\\Delta_4\\) must equal 0.\nIf four points 1, 2, 3, 4 are placed in space, then\n\\(\\Delta_4 = 288V^2\\), where \\(V\\) is the volume of the tetrahedron with vertices at these points. From this, it is clear that the condition \\(\\Delta_4 &gt; 0\\) is necessary for the possibility of placing points in space.\nLet’s explain why the conditions \\(\\Delta_4 &gt; 0\\) + \\(r_{ij} &gt; 0\\) are sufficient for this. If we fix all distances except \\(r_{34}\\), then triangles 123 and 124 can be rotated around the common edge 12 (the dihedral angle \\(\\phi\\) between them varies from 0° to 180°). Then \\(\\Delta_4\\) as a function of \\(x = r_{34}\\) will be a quadratic trinomial with a negative leading coefficient. Its roots correspond to those values of \\(x\\) for which the triangles lie in one plane (\\(\\phi = 0°\\) and \\(\\phi = 180°\\)). When \\(\\phi\\) changes from 0° to 180°, the value of \\(x\\) runs through all values between the roots, i.e., all values for which \\(\\Delta_4(x) &gt; 0\\).\nBy the way, we note that in a similar way, using a determinant, we can write Heron’s formula for the area \\(S\\) of a triangle with sides \\(r_{12}\\), \\(r_{13}\\), \\(r_{23}\\):\n\\(S^2 = \\Delta_3 / (2^2(2!)^2) = \\Delta_3 / 16\\),\nwhere \\[\\Delta_3 = \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & r_{12}^2 & r_{13}^2 & 1 \\\\ r_{12}^2 & 0 & r_{23}^2 & 1 \\\\ r_{13}^2 & r_{23}^2 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} \\text{ (see [83, 86]).}\\]\nProblem 3-18. Answer: 5, 8, 9, 10, or 11.\nFigure 37 shows examples of division into 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 parts. We will prove that there cannot be a different number of parts.\nIf all lines are parallel to each other, then there are five parts.\nSuppose not all lines are parallel. Consider a pair of intersecting lines - they divide the plane into 4 angles. Each newly drawn line intersects at least two parts into which the plane is divided by the already drawn lines, and divides each of these parts into two. Therefore, each subsequent line adds at least two new parts. In particular, four lines, among which there are non-parallel ones, divide the plane into at least \\(4 + 2 \\times 2 = 8\\) parts.\nNow we will prove that there are no more than eleven parts. We will draw the lines one by one. The first two lines divide the plane into no more than four parts. The third line has no more than two intersection points with the previous lines, is divided by them into no more than three parts, and therefore the number of parts increases by no more than three.\nThe fourth line is divided by the intersection points with the previous ones into no more than four parts and therefore adds no more than four new parts.\nIn total, we get no more than \\(4 + 3 + 4 = 11\\) parts.\nThis problem naturally generalizes: into how many parts can \\(n\\) different lines divide the plane?\nReasoning similar to what we did above, we can prove that the number of parts is either equal to \\((n+1)\\) or lies in the interval from \\(2n\\) to \\((n^2 + n + 2)/2\\). But, it turns out, not every number of parts in this interval can be realized. For example, 5 lines cannot divide the plane into \\(2 \\times 5 + 1 = 11\\) parts and, in general, \\(n\\) lines for \\(n &gt; 5\\) cannot divide the plane into \\((2n + 1)\\) parts. It would be interesting to find out which numbers from the interval from \\(2n\\) to \\((n^2 + n + 2)/2\\) can be realized for \\(n\\) lines.\nThe question of what kind of regions \\(n\\) lines in general position (no three of which pass through one point and no two are parallel) divide the plane into is also interesting. For \\(n = 4\\), the arrangement of lines in general position will always be as in Figure 37, i.e., among the three finite regions there is always one quadrilateral, two triangles, among the eight infinite ones there are four “infinite” triangles and one “infinite” quadrilateral. For \\(n &gt; 5\\), different cases (by the number of triangles and other regions) are already possible.\nThe problem of estimating the maximum number of triangles in the partition of the plane by \\(n\\) lines is essentially equivalent to the following problem by V.I. Arnold: let all \\(a_n = (n^2 + n + 2)/2\\) regions of the partition be colored with two colors - black and white - so that neighboring regions (bordering along a line segment or a ray) are colored in different colors, and the number of black regions is equal to \\(b_n\\). What is the largest value that the ratio \\(b_n/a_n\\) can take?\nIt can be proved (using, for example, Euler’s theorem - see problem 5-15) that \\(b_n/a_n &lt; 2/3\\) (for any \\(n\\)), and in the partition with the largest number of black regions, all (or almost all) of them must be triangles.\nInteresting facts are contained in the article [127]. See also [128], [129].\nProblem 3-19. Answer: 4 planes divide space into 14 parts, 5 planes divide space into 22 parts.\nLet’s prove this. Three planes \\(\\alpha_1\\), \\(\\alpha_2\\), \\(\\alpha_3\\) divide space into 8 parts. When we draw the fourth plane \\(\\alpha_4\\), it intersects the three previous ones along three lines passing through their common point. These lines divide the plane \\(\\alpha_4\\) into 6 angles. Consequently, out of the 8 parts into which space was divided by the planes \\(\\alpha_1\\), \\(\\alpha_2\\), \\(\\alpha_3\\), the fourth plane \\(\\alpha_4\\) intersects 6 parts and divides each of them into 2 parts. Thus, another 6 parts are added, for a total of \\(8 + 6 = 14\\).\nSimilarly, the fifth plane, intersecting the previous ones along four lines, adds \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) parts, and there become \\(14 + 8 = 22\\).\nIn the general case, for \\(n\\) planes, the proof can be carried out similarly: the 6th, 7th, …, \\(n\\)th planes add, respectively, \\(2 \\times 5\\), \\(2 \\times 6\\), …, \\(2(n-1)\\) new parts, and the total number of parts becomes (it is convenient to write the sum starting from the first term) \\[2 + 2 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 2 + ... + 2(n-1).\\] To find this sum, it is convenient to add the numbers in pairs from different ends: \\[2 + 2(n-1) + 2 \\times 1 + 2(n-2) + ... + 2(\\frac{n-1}{2}) + 2(\\frac{n+1}{2}) = (1 + (n-1)) + (2 + (n-2)) + ... + ((\\frac{n-1}{2}) + (\\frac{n+1}{2})) = n \\times \\frac{n}{2} = \\frac{n^2}{2}.\\] \\[2 + 2 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 2 + ... + 2(n-1) = 2 + 2 \\times \\frac{(n-1)n}{2} = n^2 - n + 2.\\] Problem 3-19 can be reduced to the planar problem 3-18 as follows: draw planes near one of the \\(n\\) planes on both sides of it. Then each of these planes will be divided by the lines of intersection with the remaining \\((n-1)\\) of the given planes into \\((1/2)((n-1)^2 + (n-1) + 2) = (n^2 - n + 2)/2\\) parts (see the discussion of problem 3-18), and these \\(n^2 - n + 2\\) parts lie exactly one each in different regions of space.\nThe description of partitions of space by \\(n\\) planes passing through one point \\(O\\) is obviously equivalent to the description of partitions of a sphere with center \\(O\\) by great circles. For example, 5 great circles in general position always divide the sphere into 10 triangles, 10 quadrilaterals, and 2 pentagons.\nFor \\(n &gt; 6\\), different types of partitions are possible (as in the previous problem 3-18 for \\(n &gt; 5\\)) (see [130], [131]).\nProblem 3-20. Let’s find the lines of intersection of the planes of opposite faces of the given tetrahedral angle. Through these two lines, we draw a plane \\(\\alpha\\). Then we draw a plane \\(\\beta\\) parallel to it, intersecting all four edges.\nWe will prove that the section is a parallelogram. The plane \\(\\beta\\) is parallel to the line of intersection of the planes of two opposite faces, and therefore it intersects them along parallel lines. Thus, in the section, we obtained a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are pairwise parallel, i.e., a parallelogram.\nNow let’s show how, using our construction, we can connect two problems 3-9 and 3-10 - see Figures 26, 38.\nConsider a quadrangular pyramid whose base is a trapezoid. Let’s draw a section of this pyramid with a plane so that the section is a parallelogram. Two opposite sides of this parallelogram will be parallel to the bases of the trapezoid.\nUnder central projection (with the center at the vertex of the tetrahedral angle), the parallelogram goes into a trapezoid, and the ratio of segments on parallel lines is preserved.\nProblem 3-21. Consider the unfolding of the lateral surface of the prism - see Figure 39.\nThe existence of the desired section is equivalent to the existence of a broken line with vertices on the four parallel lines of the unfolding, such that all three of its segments have the same length \\(x\\), and the ends lie on a line perpendicular to these parallel lines. Thus, it is sufficient to prove that the equation \\[\\sqrt{x^2 - a^2} + \\sqrt{x^2 - b^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 - c^2} \\quad (1)\\] has a solution for \\(a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; 0\\), \\(a &lt; b + c\\). Consider the function \\[f(x) = \\sqrt{x^2 - a^2} + \\sqrt{x^2 - b^2} - \\sqrt{x^2 - c^2}.\\] This function is defined for \\(x^2 &gt; a^2\\) and is continuous. Note that \\[f(a) = \\sqrt{a^2 - b^2} - \\sqrt{a^2 - c^2} &lt; 0,\\] since \\(b &gt; c\\), and \\[f(a+b) = \\sqrt{(a+b)^2 - a^2} + \\sqrt{(a+b)^2 - b^2} - \\sqrt{(a+b)^2 - c^2} = \\sqrt{2ab + b^2} + \\sqrt{2ab + a^2} - \\sqrt{a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - c^2} &gt; 0.\\] If the values of a continuous function at the ends of a segment have different signs, then at some point inside the segment the function becomes zero. In our case, these conditions are satisfied on the segment \\([a, a+b]\\). Therefore, at some point \\(x_0\\) inside this segment, the function \\(f\\) becomes zero: \\(f(x_0) = 0\\), and thus the equation has a solution.\nBy solving equation (1), we will find a formula with which the broken line can be constructed using a compass and ruler.\nExplanation:\nThe problem deals with finding a specific type of section of a triangular prism. By unfolding the lateral surface of the prism, the problem is transformed into a geometric problem on a plane. The goal is to find a broken line with three equal segments connecting four parallel lines, with its endpoints lying on a line perpendicular to these parallel lines.\nThe proof uses the Intermediate Value Theorem. The function \\(f(x)\\) represents the difference between the sum of the lengths of the two shorter segments of the broken line and the length of the longest segment. By showing that \\(f(a) &lt; 0\\) and \\(f(a+b) &gt; 0\\), we demonstrate that there exists a value \\(x_0\\) within the interval \\([a, a+b]\\) where \\(f(x_0) = 0\\). This means that for this value \\(x_0\\), the sum of the lengths of the two shorter segments equals the length of the longest segment, satisfying the conditions for the desired section.\nFinally, the note suggests that by solving equation (1) for \\(x\\), we can obtain a formula that allows us to construct the broken line (and therefore the section of the prism) using a compass and ruler, which is a classic problem in Euclidean geometry.\nProblem 3-22. Answer: it can.\nLet’s construct an example. Consider a triangular pyramid whose base is a regular triangle, the dihedral angles at the base are acute, and the lateral edges are different. From two copies of such a pyramid, gluing them along a common base, you can make a hexahedron (bipyramid) in three different ways - see Figure 40, a. All of them have the same set of faces, but are not equal to each other. Another example is shown in Figure 40, b.\nIf Andrei had numbered all the edges and written their numbers next to the edges on each face, then Kolya would have glued exactly the same convex polyhedron: if the faces of one convex polyhedron are respectively equal to the faces of another convex polyhedron, then these polyhedra are equal (Cauchy’s theorem - see [83, 99]).\nFor non-convex polyhedra, Cauchy’s theorem ceases to be true. See Figure 41 for an example.\nSince the middle of the last century, the following question has arisen: does there exist a non-rigid polyhedron composed of rigid, hinged faces - plates? Only in 1977 did the American mathematician R. Connelly construct an example of such a polyhedron ([50, 83]).\nProblem 3-23. Answer: yes, it exists.\nLet’s construct such a polyhedron - Figure 42.\nConsider a quadrangular pyramid ABCDE, the base of which is a rhombus ABCD, and the vertex E is projected into the center of the rhombus. Consider in the plane of the base a square AXBCXD with diagonal BD (BD is the smaller diagonal of the rhombus) and a cube whose lower base is this square. Take the intersection of the cube with the pyramid and the part of the pyramid lying above the cube. As a result, we get the desired polyhedron.\nAn expert could answer the question of problem 3-23 quite simply.\nIt is enough to draw a flat diagram shown in Figure 43 and refer to Steinitz’s theorem, which states that under natural conditions on a flat diagram, there exists a convex polyhedron whose faces, edges, and vertices are interconnected in the same way as regions, links, and nodes of this diagram - compare the diagram in Figure 43 with Figure 42 - see [99].\nProblem 3-24. Let the acute-angled triangle \\(D_1D_2D_3\\) with midlines AB, AC, and BC (see Figure 44) be the unfolding of the triangular pyramid ABCD (vertices \\(D_1\\), \\(D_2\\), and \\(D_3\\) are glued into one point D). If the edge corresponds to half of the side of the triangle \\(D_1D_2D_3\\), then the edge skew to it corresponds to the midline parallel to this side, and vice versa. Therefore, the skew edges of the pyramid are equal.\nLet’s construct a parallelepiped, four non-adjacent vertices of which are the vertices of a triangular pyramid. To do this, we draw a plane through each edge of the pyramid parallel to the edge skew to it.\nExplanation of Problem 3-24:\nThis problem explores the relationship between the unfolding of a triangular pyramid and the properties of its edges. The key observation is that when the pyramid is unfolded into a triangle, the edges that are skew (i.e., do not share a common vertex) in the pyramid correspond to segments in the unfolded triangle that have a specific relationship: one is half of a side of the triangle, and the other is the midline parallel to that side. This leads to the conclusion that skew edges in the pyramid have equal lengths.\nThe second part of the problem involves constructing a parallelepiped that contains the triangular pyramid. This is achieved by drawing planes through each edge of the pyramid, parallel to the edge that is skew to it. The intersection of these planes forms the parallelepiped. This construction highlights a connection between the geometry of the pyramid and a simpler, more regular shape.\nWe obtain three pairs of parallel planes, the intersection of which forms a parallelepiped. Since the skew edges of the original pyramid are equal, each face of the parallelepiped is a parallelogram with equal diagonals, i.e., a rectangle. A parallelepiped whose all faces are rectangles is a rectangular parallelepiped, which is what we needed to prove.\nInterestingly, the converse statement is also true.\nIf the vertices of a tetrahedron are four non-adjacent vertices of some rectangular parallelepiped, then its unfolding is an acute-angled triangle in which the midlines are drawn.\nIndeed (Figure 45), three identical triangles are adjacent to each vertex, and they are adjacent with their three different angles; thus, the sum of the plane angles at the vertex of the tetrahedron is 180°. A tetrahedron whose all faces are identical, but not necessarily regular triangles, is often called an isosceles tetrahedron. Such a tetrahedron has the following properties:\nInterestingly, each of these properties can be used to derive all the others.\nProblem 3-25. Answer: \\(\\pi - \\alpha\\), \\(\\pi - \\beta\\), and \\(\\pi - \\gamma\\).\nLet’s choose two of the three constructed rays. Let the faces perpendicular to them form a dihedral angle \\(\\alpha\\). Its edge is perpendicular to the plane in which the selected rays lie, so it cuts a linear angle \\(\\alpha\\) on this plane. The sides of this linear angle and the selected rays divide the plane into four angles; one of them is equal to \\(\\alpha\\), two adjacent to it are right angles, the remaining - the fourth angle - is \\(\\pi - \\alpha\\). The angle between the selected rays is equal to \\(\\pi - \\alpha\\).\nProblem 3-25 shows how the plane angles of one trihedral angle are related to the dihedral angles of another. For trihedral angles, it is easy to derive the cosine formula, which makes it possible, knowing its plane angles A, B, C, to find the dihedral angles; for example, the cosine of the dihedral angle \\(\\gamma\\) can be calculated as:\n\\[\\cos \\gamma = \\frac{\\cos C - \\cos A \\cos B}{\\sin A \\sin B} \\quad (1)\\]\nAt first glance, it is much more difficult to solve the inverse problem: knowing the dihedral angles \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\), find the cosines of the plane angles. However, if we use the new trihedral angle constructed in problem 3-25, then the required formula is obtained automatically.\nWe know from the problem that if A, B, C are the plane angles of the original trihedral angle, then \\(\\alpha' = \\pi - \\alpha\\), \\(\\beta' = \\pi - \\beta\\), \\(\\gamma' = \\pi - \\gamma\\) are the dihedral angles, and \\(A' = \\pi - A\\), \\(B' = \\pi - B\\), \\(C' = \\pi - C\\) are the plane angles of the new trihedral angle:\n\\[\\cos C' = \\frac{\\cos \\gamma' - \\cos \\alpha' \\cos \\beta'}{\\sin \\alpha' \\sin \\beta'} \\quad (2)\\]\nFormulas (1) and (2) are also called the cosine formulas for spherical triangles. Consider a sphere of unit radius with center at the vertex of the trihedral angle. The trihedral angle cuts out a curvilinear triangle on this sphere. Its sides are arcs of great circles of radius 1, their lengths are respectively equal to the values of the plane angles A, B, C (taken in radians) of the trihedral angle. Its angles are the dihedral angles \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\) of the trihedral angle. Formula (1) allows us to find its angles from its three sides, and formula (2) allows us to find its sides from its three angles.\nThe trihedral angle constructed in problem 3-25 also cuts out a triangle on the sphere, which is called the polar to the first one. The problem establishes how their sides and angles are related to each other.",

    "text": "4.1 Problems Discussion\nProblem 4-1. By two methods of calculating the area of a triangle, we get \\(ch = ab\\), hence \\(h = \\frac{ab}{c}\\). The inequality \\(c + h &gt; a + b\\) can be written as: [ + c &gt; a + b. ] Multiplying both sides by \\(c\\) (where \\(c &gt; 0\\)), we obtain the equivalent inequality: [ c^2 - c(a+b) + ab &gt; 0, ] or [ (c - a)(c - b) &gt; 0. ] This inequality is true because the hypotenuse is greater than each leg.\n\\(\\nabla\\) In solving this problem, we established that if the products \\(ch\\) and \\(ab\\) of two pairs of positive numbers are equal, then the sum is greater for the pair whose numbers are more “spread out”: if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are between \\(c\\) and \\(h\\), then \\(c + h &gt; a + b\\). This fact also follows from the fact that the function \\(f(x) = x + \\frac{A}{x}\\) is monotonically increasing for \\(x \\geq A\\).\nProblem 4-2. Answer: \\(c &lt; 0\\).\nConsider the function \\(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\\). By condition, it does not cross zero, so its graph - a parabola - is either entirely above or entirely below the x-axis.\nNotice that \\(f(1) = a + b + c\\); this number, by condition, is less than zero, which means the parabola is below the x-axis. Therefore \\(f(x) &lt; 0\\) for all values of \\(x\\) and, in particular, \\(f(0) = c &lt; 0\\).\n∇ In the solution, we essentially used the continuity of the function \\(f\\): if a function is continuous on an interval and does not become zero on it, then all its values on this interval have the same sign.\nProblem 4-3. Let’s draw the axes of symmetry of the rectangle. They divide the given rectangle into 4 quarters. If the selected point lies in any of the two quarters containing points A and C, or on the boundary of these quarters, then the statement of the problem is obvious. Let the selected point lie inside one of the two remaining quarters. Reflect both cut lines with respect to the center of symmetry of the rectangle. Four lines (two cut lines and two symmetrical to them) divide the rectangle into 9 parts: four parts with area \\(S_1\\), two parts with area \\(S_2\\), two parts with area \\(S_3\\), and one part with area \\(S_0\\) (Fig. 46). We must prove that \\(S_1 + S_2\\) or \\(S_1 + S_3\\) does not exceed \\(\\frac{S}{4}\\), where \\(S\\) is the area of the entire rectangle.\nSince \\[4S_1 + 2S_2 + 2S_3 = S - S_0 &lt; S,\\] then \\[2S_1 + S_2 + S_3 &lt; \\frac{S}{2}, \\text{ or } (S_1 + S_2) + (S_1 + S_3) &lt; \\frac{S}{2}.\\] This means that one of the numbers \\(S_1 + S_2\\), \\(S_1 + S_3\\) is less than \\(\\frac{S}{4}\\) (if both were not less than \\(\\frac{S}{4}\\), then their sum would be not less than \\(\\frac{S}{2}\\)).\n∇ The following stereometric problem, similar to problem 4-3, is of interest: let \\(V_1 \\leq V_2 \\leq \\dots \\leq V_8\\) be the volumes of the eight parts into which a parallelepiped of volume 1 is divided by three planes passing through its point and parallel to its faces; within what limits can each of the values \\(V_i\\), \\(i = 1, 2, \\dots, 8\\) vary? For example, it turns out that \\(0 \\leq V_4 \\leq \\frac{1}{8}\\) and for any \\(V_4\\) from this interval, there is a corresponding partition of the parallelepiped. (When proving the inequality \\(V_4 \\leq \\frac{1}{8}\\), it is convenient to use the fact that two opposite parts have volumes whose products are not greater than \\(\\frac{1}{64}\\).) A similar question can be considered for an \\(n\\)-dimensional parallelepiped of unit volume.\nProblem 4-4. Answer: if the bank accrues interest once a month. Let the interest be accrued once a year. Then at the end of the first year, the deposit will be equal to \\[\\left(1000 + 1000 \\cdot \\frac{5}{100} \\right) = 1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right) \\text{ rubles}.\\] At the end of the second year, the deposit will increase by 5% from this amount and will become equal to \\[1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right) = 1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right)^2 \\text{ rubles}.\\] Reasoning similarly, we see that after 10 years the depositor will receive \\[1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right)^{10} \\text{ rubles}.\\] If interest is accrued once a month, then in the same way we find that the depositor will receive after 10 years (i.e., after 120 months) \\[1000 \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{1200} \\right)^{120} \\text{ rubles}.\\] We will show that the second number is greater than the first. To do this, it is enough to show that \\[\\left(1 + \\frac{5}{100} \\right) &lt; \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{1200} \\right)^{12}.\\] Let’s start calculating the right side of this inequality – the product of twelve identical expressions \\[\\left(1 + \\frac{5}{1200} \\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{1200} \\right) \\dots \\left(1 + \\frac{5}{1200} \\right).\\] In the process of multiplication, we will have to take 1 in each bracket and multiply them all – we get 1 as a result. If we take \\(\\frac{5}{1200}\\) in one bracket and 1 in the others, then we get \\(\\frac{5}{1200}\\); but there are as many such products as there are brackets, i.e. 12, and they give the number \\(12 \\cdot \\frac{5}{1200} = \\frac{5}{100}\\). Although we have not taken into account all the terms, we already got \\(1 + \\frac{5}{100}\\), so the entire product will be greater than this number.\n∇ Let K rubles be deposited in the bank and the bank pays p% per annum. Reasoning in the same way as in the solution to problem 4-4, we will see that after m years the depositor will receive \\(K \\left(1 + \\frac{p}{100} \\right)^m\\) rubles (the so-called compound interest formula). This value can be roughly estimated from below using Bernoulli’s inequality, which we have essentially already proved: \\[\\left(1 + x \\right)^n &gt; 1 + nx \\text{ for } x &gt; 0, n &gt; 1.\\] (In the solution to problem 4-4, it was \\(x = \\frac{5}{1200}\\), \\(n = 12\\).) It follows from this inequality that if we reduce the payment periods and proportionally reduce the interest rate, then the depositor will receive a larger amount. This is due to the fact that for \\(a &gt; 0\\) the sequence \\[x = \\left(1 + \\frac{a}{n} \\right)^n\\] is increasing. However, it turns out that the depositor will not be able to get too much benefit from reducing the terms, since this sequence is bounded. Its limit is the number \\(e^a\\). If you calculate the sums from problem 4-4 on a calculator, then in the first case we get about 1629 rubles, in the second – about 1647 rubles, and \\(1000e^{0.05} \\approx 1649\\).\nLet there be \\(k\\) overcrowded and \\(l\\) non-overcrowded buses in the column. Denote the number of passengers traveling in overcrowded buses by \\(A\\), and the number of the rest by \\(B\\). Then \\(A &gt; 50k\\), \\(B \\leq 50l\\), and therefore \\(\\frac{A}{k} &gt; 50\\), \\(\\frac{B}{l} \\leq 50\\). Thus, \\(\\frac{A}{k} &gt; \\frac{B}{l}\\). From the last inequality, the following follows: \\[\\frac{B}{A} &lt; \\frac{l}{k},\\] \\[\\frac{A + B}{A} &lt; \\frac{l + k}{k},\\] \\[\\frac{A}{A + B} &gt; \\frac{k}{l + k},\\] from where \\[\\frac{A}{A + B} \\cdot 100\\% &gt; \\frac{k}{l + k} \\cdot 100\\%.\\] In the last inequality, on the left is the percentage of people traveling in overcrowded buses, and on the right is the percentage of overcrowded buses.\nProblem 4-6. Answer: a) 7; b) 16. Let there be \\(n\\) participants in the circle, of which \\(m\\) are girls. We need to find the smallest natural number \\(n\\) for which there exists such a natural number \\(m\\) that \\[\\frac{2}{5} &lt; \\frac{m}{n} &lt; \\frac{1}{2}.\\] Iterating through the values of \\(n\\) from 2 to 7, we find that only the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\) with denominator 7 satisfies this inequality. Thus, 7 is the smallest possible value of \\(n\\).\n∇ Note that the fraction \\(\\frac{3}{7}\\) is obtained from the fractions \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as follows: its numerator is the sum of their numerators, and the denominator is the sum of their denominators.\nFor any positive fractions \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\) (\\(\\frac{a}{b} &lt; \\frac{c}{d}\\)), the fraction \\(\\frac{a+c}{b+d}\\) satisfies the inequalities \\(\\frac{a}{b} &lt; \\frac{a+c}{b+d} &lt; \\frac{c}{d}\\) and is called the mediant of these fractions.\nWriting out irreducible fractions with a denominator not exceeding \\(n\\) in ascending order, we get the following table:  Each \\(n\\)-th row (Farey sequence) is obtained from the \\((n-1)\\)-th row according to the following rule: in the \\((n-1)\\)-th row, one needs to mark all such pairs of neighboring fractions \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\), \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\), for which the sum of the denominators is equal to \\(n\\), and insert their mediants – fractions \\(\\frac{a+c}{b+d}\\) (they are always irreducible) between them.\nIn problem a), we found the row number \\(n=7\\), in which the fraction located between the fractions \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) first appears.\nIn problem b), acting by brute force is quite tedious. Let’s proceed as follows. We must find a solution to the inequalities \\[\n\\frac{43}{100} &lt; \\frac{m}{n} &lt; \\frac{44}{100} = \\frac{11}{25}\n\\] with the smallest natural \\(n\\).\nLet’s invert all the fractions and subtract their common integer part: \\[\n\\frac{n}{43} - 2 &gt; \\frac{m}{11} &gt; \\frac{25}{11} - 2\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{n-86}{43} &gt; \\frac{m}{11} &gt; \\frac{3}{11}\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{11(n-86)}{43} &gt; m &gt; 3\n\\] Let’s do the same thing again: \\[\n\\frac{1}{m-3(n-2m)} = \\frac{1}{7m-3n} \\le \\frac{2}{3}\n\\] and one more time: \\[\n\\frac{14}{n-2m} &gt; \\frac{3}{7m-3n} &gt; 2\n\\] Notice that here, for the first time, integers appear between the bounds of the inequality. The smallest of them is the number 2. The system of equations \\(n-2m=2\\), \\(7m-3n=1\\) has a solution in natural numbers \\(n=16\\), \\(m=7\\).\nLet’s prove that this is the solution to the problem. From inequalities (2)–(4) it follows that \\[\nn-2m &gt; 0, \\quad 7m-3n \\ge 1, \\quad n-2m \\ge 2\n\\] Therefore \\[\nn = 7(n-2m) + 2(7m-3n) \\ge 7 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 16\n\\] ∇ Analyzing this solution, we notice that, in essence, we are expanding the numbers \\(\\frac{43}{100}\\) and \\(\\frac{11}{25}\\) into continued fractions: \\[\n\\frac{43}{100} = \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{14}{43}} = \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac{1}{14}}}\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{11}{25} = \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{3}{11}} = \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac{2}{3}}}\n\\] Then we take the common part of these expansions at the step where the expansions differ, between \\(\\frac{1}{14}\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) we insert the smallest integer, i.e. 1, and as a result we get the answer: \\[\n\\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{3+1}} = \\frac{1}{2+\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{16}{36}\n\\] This algorithm allows you to quickly find a fraction \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) with the smallest denominator \\(n\\) in any given interval \\(0 &lt; \\alpha &lt; \\frac{m}{n} &lt; \\beta\\) (see [61, 119]).\nProblem 4-7. Answer: The maximum distance is 620454/11 km. Tires need to be changed so that each of them is front for one third of the way.\nLet’s take as a unit the amount of rubber that can be worn out on one tire before it becomes unusable. Then, before the trip, there are 6 units of rubber in total. From the condition, it follows that for 1 km of the path, 1/15000 units are erased if the tire is in front, and 1/25000 if it is in the back. This means that for 1 km of the path, 2/15000 + 4/25000 = 11/37500 units of rubber are erased. Let the car have travelled x km. Then 11x/37500 units of rubber have been erased. Since no more than 6 units can be erased, we have \\[\n\\frac{11x}{37500} \\le 6\n\\] from where \\[\nx \\le \\frac{20454}{11} \\times 6\n\\] To drive all 20454/11 km, it is necessary to change the tires so that each of them is in front for a third of this distance: then they will all wear out simultaneously - by the end of the journey.\nProblem 4-8. Answer: 12 minutes.\nIt is quite clear that if the Kid and Carlson want to eat breakfast in the shortest possible time, then they must start and finish eating at the same time - otherwise, one of them can help the other and reduce the time spent.\nLet us denote by x, y, z the shares of cake, jam and milk that the Kid ate; then (1-x), (1-y), (1-z) are the shares of these products that Carlson ate, and the time they spent is equal to \\[\nt = 10x + 13y + 14z = 6(1-x) + 6(1-y) + 7(1-z)\n\\] Thus, we come to the following problem: find the minimum value of the quantity t = 10x + 13y + 14z, if the numbers x, y, z satisfy the conditions 0≤x≤1, 0≤y≤1, 0≤z≤1 and \\[\n10x + 13y + 14z = 6(1-x) + 6(1-y) + 7(1-z)\n\\] From the last relation, one can express z in terms of x and y: \\[\nz = \\frac{1}{21}(19 - 16x - 19y)\n\\] Substituting this expression into the formula for t, we get \\[\nt = -\\frac{2}{3}x + \\frac{1}{3}y + \\frac{38}{3}\n\\] From this formula, we see that \\(t\\) will be smaller the larger \\(x\\) is and the smaller \\(y\\) is. Let’s take the largest possible value of \\(x\\) and the smallest possible value of \\(y\\): \\(x=1, y=0\\). In this case, \\(t=12\\) minutes, and \\(z\\) is within the permissible limits. Consequently, the minimum value of \\(t\\) is achieved in the case when the Kid eats the cake and drinks the milk, and Carlson eats all the jam and drinks the milk.\n\\(\\nabla\\) We have reduced problem 4-8 to a linear programming problem: find the minimum of a linear function under the condition that the variables are non-negative and satisfy a system of linear inequalities and equations.\nIf it were required to solve a similar problem for \\(n &gt; 3\\) products, then such a solution method would lead to rather cumbersome calculations; however, it is possible to specify a simple general rule that indicates the optimal plan for the distribution of products.\nLet \\(a_i\\) be the time it takes for the Kid to eat the \\(i\\)-th product, and \\(b_i\\) be the time it takes for Carlson to eat it; we will assume that the products are numbered in ascending order of the ratios of these times: \\[\\frac{a_1}{b_1} \\le \\frac{a_2}{b_2} \\le ... \\le \\frac{a_n}{b_n}. \\quad (1)\\] The plan, in which the breakfast time will be the smallest, is as follows: the Kid starts with the first product and eats them further in the order of numbers, and Carlson starts simultaneously with him from the last product and eats them in reverse order.\nIn our problem, three products should be ordered as follows: the first is the cake, the second is the milk, the third is the jam. The ratios of times will then satisfy the inequalities \\[\\frac{10}{6} \\le \\frac{4}{7} \\le \\frac{13}{6}.\\] In the first 6 minutes, Carlson eats the jam, and the Kid eats part of the cake. In the next 4 minutes, the Kid finishes the cake, and Carlson drinks \\(\\frac{4}{7}\\) of the milk. And finally, in the last 2 minutes, they both finish the milk.\nTo prove the optimality of the proposed plan, it is convenient to introduce a conditional measure for each product. We will consider the nutritional value of the \\(i\\)-th product to be equal to \\((a_i + b_i)\\) calories, then the eating rate (calories per unit of time) when eating the \\(i\\)-th product for the Kid is equal to \\(\\frac{a_i+b_i}{a_i} = 1 + \\frac{b_i}{a_i}\\), and for Carlson \\(\\frac{a_i+b_i}{b_i} = 1 + \\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\). We see that the Kid’s speed is greater the smaller \\(\\frac{a_i}{b_i}\\) is, and Carlson’s speed is the opposite. Thus, in order to get as many calories as possible in time \\(t\\), the Kid should eat the products in the order of numbers, and Carlson in the reverse order. Let the Kid and Carlson get all \\((a_1 + b_1) + ... + (a_n + b_n)\\) calories in some time \\(t\\) according to our plan. Then, with any other plan, in the same time \\(t\\), they will receive fewer calories, which means they will not be able to eat all the products.\nYou can specify a graphical procedure that gives the answer. Let’s draw in the second quarter of the coordinate plane \\(Oxy\\) a broken line whose links are vectors with coordinates \\((b_1, a_1), (b_2, a_2), ..., (b_n, a_n)\\), going in such an order that inequalities (1) are satisfied; the beginning \\(M\\) of this broken line lies on the \\(Ox\\) axis, the end \\(K\\) on the \\(Oy\\) axis (Fig. 47 corresponds to the case \\(n = 3\\); in problem 4-8, the three vectors that make up the broken line have coordinates \\((6, 10), (7, 14)\\), and \\((6, 13)\\)).\nLet’s mark the point \\(L\\) of intersection of this broken line with the bisector \\(x + y = 0\\) of the second coordinate quarter. The ordinate \\(t\\) of the point \\(L\\) indicates the desired minimal time, and the part \\(ML\\) of the broken line indicates the products that Malysh eats, and the part \\(LK\\) indicates the products that Karlsson eats.\nProblem 4-9. Answer: 10 or 11 trains.\nLet the trains depart with an interval of \\(T\\) minutes. Since in 12 minutes 4 full intervals have definitely passed, \\(4T \\le 12\\), i.e., \\(T \\le 3\\). Since no more than \\(T\\) minutes have passed before the departure of the first of the 5 trains and after the departure of the last of them, \\(T + 4T + T &gt; 12\\), i.e., \\(T &gt; 2\\). So, \\(2 &lt; T \\le 3\\).\nSimilarly, from the fact that exactly 6 trains departed in 20 minutes, we get \\(\\frac{20}{7} &lt; T \\le 4\\). From these inequalities it follows that \\(2 &lt; T \\le 3\\).\nLet \\(n\\) trains depart in 30 minutes. Then, similarly, we get \\((n-1)T \\le 30 &lt; (n+1)T\\) or \\(\\frac{30}{T} - 1 &lt; n \\le \\frac{30}{T} + 1\\).\nTaking into account that \\(2 &lt; T \\le 3\\), we find that \\(9 &lt; n \\le 11\\), i.e., \\(n = 10\\) or \\(n = 11\\).\nIf \\(T = 3\\) and the first train departs immediately upon Vitya’s arrival, then 11 trains will depart in 30 minutes, and if with the same \\(T\\) the first train departs 1 minute after his arrival, then 10 trains will depart in 30 minutes, i.e., both answer options are realized.\n\\(\\nabla\\) The solution to this problem is related to the following general question. Let points be placed on a straight line at equal distances \\(T\\) from each other. What is the number \\(n\\) of these points that a segment of length \\(b\\) can contain?\nAnswer: \\(\\frac{b}{T} - 1 &lt; n \\le \\frac{b}{T} + 1\\).\nProblem 4-10. Answer: 5 three-ton trucks.\nLet’s first show that 4 three-ton trucks may not be enough. Let’s take 13 identical boxes weighing \\(\\frac{10}{13}\\) tons each. Then we cannot put more than three boxes in one three-ton truck, and no more than 12 boxes in four trucks.\nNow let’s prove that 5 three-ton trucks are always enough. Indeed, we can load at least two tons of cargo into each three-ton truck (if less than two tons are loaded, we can add another box). Then at least 10 tons can be loaded into 5 three-ton trucks.\n\\(\\nabla\\) A more general problem. Several boxes weigh a total of \\(T\\) tons, and each of them weighs no more than 1 ton. What is the minimum number of \\(p\\)-ton trucks (\\(p &gt; 1\\)) that is definitely enough to carry all this cargo at once?\nLet \\(\\gamma = \\frac{p}{[p] + 1}\\), where \\([p]\\) is the integer part of the number \\(p\\). Then the answer is the smallest integer \\(N\\) greater than or equal to \\(\\frac{T - \\gamma}{p - \\gamma}\\).\nIn the example showing that a smaller number of trucks may not be enough, it is necessary to take all the loads equal (and slightly larger than \\(\\gamma\\)). You can load \\(N\\) trucks in descending order of their masses. For the proof, it is convenient to use the following lemma: if there are several boxes with a total mass of more than \\(p\\) tons (each is no more than 1), then you can load more than \\(p - \\gamma\\) tons onto a \\(p\\)-ton truck. In problem 4-10, \\(p = 3\\), \\(T = 10\\), \\(\\gamma = \\frac{3}{4}\\); it follows from the lemma that more than \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) tons can be loaded onto one three-ton truck, and the weight of the cargo, 10 tons, as we know, can be transported on 5 three-ton trucks; this is exactly the smallest integer greater than or equal to \\(\\frac{T - \\gamma}{p - \\gamma} = \\frac{37}{9}\\).\nFor experts. It is interesting to compare this problem with the “stone problem” often encountered in applications. There are several stones with known masses \\(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\) and a \\(p\\)-ton truck (\\(p, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\\) are natural numbers). The question is whether it is possible to select several of these stones so as to completely load the \\(p\\)-ton truck with them. In other words, are there such numbers \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\), equal to 0 or 1, that the equality \\(a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = p\\) is satisfied?\nThe latter problem belongs to the class of so-called universal enumeration problems. There is no known algorithm for solving them that works significantly faster than brute-force enumeration of all options. (Unlike this problem, loading boxes, which was discussed in the generalization of problem 4-10, can be done very quickly; see [97].)\nProblem 4-11. Answer: either all three numbers are equal to zero, or one of them is equal to zero, and the other two are ones.\nNote that all three numbers are non-negative, since each of them is a square. Let’s denote them in descending order as follows: \\[x \\ge y \\ge z \\ge 0.\\] Then \\(x - z \\ge y - z \\ge 0\\), whence \\((x - z)^2 \\ge (y - z)^2\\). But \\((x - z)^2 = y\\), and \\((y - z)^2 = x\\). So, on the one hand, \\(x \\ge y\\), on the other hand, \\(y \\ge x\\), and thus \\(x = y\\). In this case, we get \\(z = 0\\) and \\(x = x^2\\), i.e., \\(x = 0\\) or \\(x = 1\\).\n\\(\\nabla\\) Inequalities were not involved in the condition of this problem, but they appeared in the solution. The idea of ordering equal unknowns helps in many other situations as well.\nProblem 4-12. Note that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) enter symmetrically into the condition of the problem, so we can assume that \\(m \\ge n \\ge 2\\). In this case, \\(m^n \\le n^n\\). Thus, it is sufficient to prove the inequality \\(n^n \\le 3^3\\) or \\[n^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}.\\] (1) If \\(n = 2\\), the inequality \\(2^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) is true, since when both sides are raised to the sixth power, we get \\(8 &lt; 9\\). Now let’s take the natural logarithm of both sides of inequality (1) and prove that \\(\\frac{\\ln n}{n} \\le \\frac{\\ln 3}{3}\\) for \\(n \\ge 3\\).\nThe derivative of the function \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{x}\\) is negative for \\(x \\ge 3\\): \\[\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{x}\\right)' = \\frac{(1 - \\ln x)}{x^2} &lt; 0,\\] since \\(\\ln x &gt; 1\\) for \\(x \\ge 3 &gt; e\\).\nHence it follows that the function \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{x}\\) is decreasing for \\(x \\ge 3\\) and, consequently, \\(\\frac{\\ln x}{x} \\le \\frac{\\ln 3}{3}\\) for \\(x \\ge 3\\).\n\\(\\nabla\\) The inequality \\(n^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) for natural \\(n \\ge 3\\) can also be proved by induction; if it is true for some \\(n = k\\), then it is also true for the next \\(n = k + 1\\): the inequality \\((k + 1)^{\\frac{1}{k+1}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) is obtained from \\(k^{\\frac{1}{k}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) by multiplying term by term by the true (for \\(k \\ge 3\\)) inequality \\(\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\le 3^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\).\nProblem 4-13. Answer: the smallest value is reached at \\(n = 10^{10} - 1\\) and at \\(n = 10^{10}\\). Let \\(a_n = \\frac{\\lg 2 \\cdot \\lg 3 \\cdot ... \\cdot \\lg n}{n}\\). Note that \\(a_n = \\left(\\frac{\\lg n}{10}\\right)^{a_n}\\).\nIf \\(\\lg n &lt; 10\\), then \\(a_n &lt; a_{n-1}\\); if \\(\\lg n = 10\\), then \\(a_n = a_{n-1}\\); if \\(\\lg n &gt; 10\\), then \\(a_n &gt; a_{n-1}\\). Thus, the sequence \\((a_n)\\) decreases up to \\(n = 10^{10} - 1\\), then has two equal terms with numbers \\(10^{10} - 1\\) and \\(10^{10}\\), and starting from the next number, the sequence increases.\nProblem 4-14. Answer: The maximum value is 1/4.\nThis value is achieved, for example, when \\(x_1 = x_2 = 1/2\\) and \\(x_3 = x_4 = x_5 = 0\\).\nLet’s show that \\(x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_3x_4 + x_4x_5 \\leq 1/4\\) for all non-negative values of \\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\). Indeed,\n\\(x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_3x_4 + x_4x_5 \\leq (x_1 + x_3 + x_5)(x_2 + x_4)\\),\nbecause if we expand the brackets on the right side, we get all the terms on the left side, plus several non-negative terms.\nNow it’s sufficient to apply the inequality between geometric and arithmetic means to two numbers, \\(u = x_1 + x_3 + x_5 \\geq 0\\) and \\(v = x_2 + x_4 \\geq 0\\), which sum to one:\n\\(uv \\leq (\\frac{u+v}{2})^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\nThus,\n\\((x_1 + x_3 + x_5)(x_2 + x_4) = uv \\leq \\frac{(u+v)^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}\\)\n\\(\\nabla\\) Similarly, it can be proved that for any \\(n\\) non-negative numbers \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\) that add up to 1, the largest value of the quantity \\(x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + ... + x_{n-1}x_n\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\).\nProblem 4-15. To prove, we compare the left and right sides of the inequality given in the condition with the expression \\(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2\\): we will prove that \\[a^4 + b^4 + c^4 \\ge a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2 \\ge a^2bc + b^2ac + c^2ab.\\] Adding term by term three valid inequalities \\(a^4 + b^4 - 2a^2b^2 \\ge 0\\), \\(b^4 + c^4 - 2b^2c^2 \\ge 0\\), \\(c^4 + a^4 - 2a^2c^2 \\ge 0\\), we get \\(2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) \\ge 2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2)\\). Adding term by term three valid inequalities \\(a^2(b^2 + c^2 - 2bc) \\ge 0\\), \\(b^2(a^2 + c^2 - 2ac) \\ge 0\\), \\(c^2(b^2 + a^2 - 2ba) \\ge 0\\), we get \\[2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2) \\ge 2(a^2bc + b^2ac + c^2ab).\\]\n\\(\\nabla\\) The following general Muirhead’s theorem is related to the inequality from problem 4-15. Let a monomial \\(x_1^{\\alpha_1}x_2^{\\alpha_2}...x_n^{\\alpha_n}\\) of \\(n\\) variables \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\) be given. Let’s call its symmetrization the polynomial \\(\\Phi_{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_n}\\), equal to the arithmetic mean of all possible monomials obtained from the given one by permutation of variables; for example, \\[\\Phi_{2, 2, 0}(x, y, z) = \\frac{1}{3}(x^2y^2 + y^2z^2 + z^2x^2).\\] Consider two sets \\(\\alpha = (\\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_n)\\) and \\(\\beta = (\\beta_1, ..., \\beta_n)\\) of exponents \\(\\alpha_1 \\ge \\alpha_2 \\ge ... \\ge \\alpha_n \\ge 0\\) and \\(\\beta_1 \\ge \\beta_2 \\ge ... \\ge \\beta_n \\ge 0\\).\nFor the inequality \\[\\Phi_{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_n} \\ge \\Phi_{\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n}\\] to hold for all non-negative values of \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\), it is necessary and sufficient that the set \\(\\alpha\\) majorizes the set \\(\\beta\\) in the following sense: \\[\\alpha_1 \\ge \\beta_1,\\] \\[\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 \\ge \\beta_1 + \\beta_2,\\] \\[...................................................\\] \\[\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + ... + \\alpha_{n-1} \\ge \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + ... + \\beta_{n-1},\\] \\[\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + ... + \\alpha_n \\ge \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + ... + \\beta_n.\\] This system of conditions is briefly written as: \\[(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_n) \\succ (\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n).\\]\nIt has the following visual interpretation: if the sets of exponents are depicted as stairs, in which the width of the steps is equal to 1, and the height is the numbers of the set, then the second set should be obtained from the first by cutting off pieces of steps and throwing them down to the right (to one of the following steps). In problem 4-15 (Fig. 48), (2, 2, 0) is obtained from the set (4, 0, 0), and (2, 1, 1) is obtained from it: \\[(4, 0, 0) \\succ (2, 2, 0) \\succ (2, 1, 1).\\] The operation of “throwing steps” suggests a way to prove any of the inequalities referred to in Muirhead’s theorem (see [102]).\nFigures of several cells that have the shape of stairs turn out to be convenient in many other combinatorial and algebraic problems (see problem 6-10).\nProblem 4-16. To get rid of the radicals, let \\(x = b^{\\frac{1}{15}}\\), \\(y = a^{\\frac{1}{10}}\\). Then the given inequality will take the form \\[3x^5 + 2y^5 - 5x^3y^2 \\ge 0.\\] Dividing both sides of the inequality by \\(y^5\\) and denoting \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\) by \\(t\\), we get the equivalent inequality \\[3t^5 - 5t^3 + 2 \\ge 0.\\] The left side is factored: \\[(t-1)^2(3t^3 + 6t^2 + 4t + 2) \\ge 0.\\] For \\(t &gt; 0\\), both factors are non-negative, so the inequality is true. It turns into equality only for \\(t = 1\\), i.e., for \\(a = b\\).\n\\(\\nabla\\) You can prove the original inequality using the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean for five numbers: \\[\\frac{1}{5}(3\\sqrt[15]{b} + 3\\sqrt[15]{b} + 3\\sqrt[15]{b} + 2\\sqrt[10]{a} + 2\\sqrt[10]{a})^5 \\ge 5(3\\sqrt[15]{b})^3 \\cdot (2\\sqrt[10]{a})^2 = 108 \\sqrt[5]{ab}.\\]\nSimilarly, it can be proved that for any \\(k\\) positive numbers \\(a_1, a_2, ..., a_k\\) and natural numbers \\(p_1, p_2, ..., p_k\\) with the sum \\(p_1 + ... + p_k = p\\), \\[\\frac{p_1 a_1^{p_1} + p_2 a_2^{p_2} + ... + p_k a_k^{p_k}}{p} \\ge (a_1 a_2 ... a_k)^{\\frac{p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_k}{p}}.\\] And here is another proof (leading to a different generalization).\nPutting \\(a = y^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\), \\(b = x^{\\frac{5}{2}}\\), we reduce the original inequality to the form \\[3x^{\\frac{5}{2}} + 2y^{\\frac{5}{3}} \\ge 5xy.\\] This is a special case of Young’s inequality: for any positive \\(x, y, \\alpha, \\beta\\), where \\(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{\\beta} = 1\\), \\[\\frac{x^\\alpha}{\\alpha} + \\frac{y^\\beta}{\\beta} \\ge xy.\\] This, in turn, is a special case of the inequality \\(f(x) + g(y) \\ge xy\\), (*) where \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are differentiable functions defined for all non-negative values of the argument, for which \\(f'\\) and \\(g'\\) are mutually inverse monotonically increasing functions, and \\[f(0) = g(0) = f'(0) = g'(0) = 0\\] (the functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) are called dual according to Young).\nNote that for each value of \\(y\\) there is exactly one value of \\(x\\) for which the inequality (*) turns into an equality; for these values \\(y = f'(x)\\) and \\(x = g'(y)\\). Therefore, the function \\(g\\) can be defined through the function \\(f\\) as follows: for each \\(k\\), \\[g(k) = \\max_x (kx - f(x)).\\] Such a transition from the function \\(f\\) to the function \\(g\\) is called the Legendre transform of the function \\(f\\). In this case, the function \\(f\\) will, in turn, be the Legendre transform of the function \\(g\\) – see Figure 49 (see [79]).\nProblem 4-17. Let’s draw three diagonals \\(AD, BE\\), and \\(CF\\) of the hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\), connecting each vertex to the opposite one. Let them intersect at the points \\(K, L, M\\) – see Figure 50, a; in the special case, the points \\(K, L\\), and \\(M\\) may coincide.\nConsider six triangles, which together with the triangle \\(KLM\\) make up the hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\) – in our figure, these are triangles \\(ABL, BCL, CDM, DEM, EFK, FAK\\) (Fig. 50, b). The area of at least one of them is not greater than \\(\\frac{S}{6}\\), where \\(S\\) is the area of the hexagon (otherwise, the sum of these six areas would be greater than \\(S\\), which is impossible). Let, for example, \\(S_{ABL} \\le \\frac{S}{6}\\) (Fig. 50, c). We claim that then the area of one of the triangles \\(ABC\\) and \\(ABF\\) with the same base \\(AB\\) is not greater than \\(\\frac{S}{6}\\). Indeed, the area of a triangle with base \\(AB\\) and height \\(h\\) is equal to \\(\\frac{AB \\cdot h}{2}\\), and the height of triangle \\(ABL\\) is enclosed between the heights of triangles \\(ABC\\) and \\(ABF\\), i.e., it is not greater than one of them.\n\\(\\nabla\\) In the last reasoning, one can single out a frequently encountered consideration: the largest value of a linear function \\(f(x)\\) defined on some interval \\([a; b]\\) is always reached at one of the ends of the interval, i.e., for any \\(x\\), the value of \\(f(x)\\) does not exceed \\(f(a)\\) or \\(f(b)\\). In our problem, such a function was the area of the triangle \\(f(h) = \\frac{AB \\cdot h}{2}\\).\nProblem 4-18. Let \\(\\alpha \\le \\beta \\le \\gamma\\). Considering \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) as fixed, let’s consider the derivative with respect to \\(\\gamma\\) of the difference between the right and left sides. It is equal to \\[\\left(3 \\sin \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma}{3} - \\sin \\alpha - \\sin \\beta - \\sin \\gamma \\right)' = \\cos \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma}{3} - \\cos \\gamma \\ge 0,\\] since \\(0 \\le \\frac{\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma}{3} \\le \\gamma \\le \\pi\\) and for \\(t \\in [0; \\pi]\\) the function \\(y = \\cos t\\) is decreasing (the derivatives of the constants \\(\\sin \\alpha\\) and \\(\\sin \\beta\\) are equal to 0). If we prove the validity of our inequality for \\(\\gamma = \\beta\\), then it will also be valid for \\(\\gamma \\ge \\beta\\) – with the growth of \\(\\gamma\\), the difference between the right and left sides of the inequality will increase. So, it remains to prove that for all \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\alpha \\le \\beta\\), \\[\\sin \\alpha + 2 \\sin \\beta \\le 3 \\sin \\frac{\\alpha + 2\\beta}{3}.\\]\nLet’s repeat the same reasoning. The derivative with respect to \\(\\beta\\) of the difference between the right and left sides is equal to \\[2 \\cos \\frac{\\alpha + 2\\beta}{3} - 2 \\cos \\beta \\ge 0,\\] since \\(0 \\le \\frac{\\alpha + 2\\beta}{3} \\le \\beta \\le \\pi\\). But for \\(\\beta = \\alpha\\), the inequality turns into an equality. Therefore, it is true for \\(\\beta \\ge \\alpha\\).\n\\(\\nabla\\) Taking \\(\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = \\pi\\) or \\(\\alpha + \\beta + \\gamma = 2\\pi\\) in the condition of the problem, we get inequalities equivalent to the fact that the perimeter and area of any triangle are not greater than those of a regular triangle with the same radius of the circumscribed circle.\nThe method by which this problem is solved allows us to prove the following general theorem. Let a function \\(f(x)\\) be defined on the interval \\([a; b]\\), whose derivative \\(f'(x)\\) does not increase (such a function is called convex upward). Then for any \\(n\\) points \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\) on this interval and for any \\(n\\) positive numbers \\(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\\) with the sum \\(p_1 + ... + p_n = 1\\), the following Jensen’s inequality holds: \\[f(p_1x_1 + ... + p_nx_n) \\ge p_1f(x_1) + ... + p_nf(x_n).\\] In our problem, \\(f(x) = \\sin x\\), \\(x \\in [0; \\pi]\\), and \\(p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\nIf we take the function \\(f(x) = \\ln x\\) and \\(p_1 = p_2 = ... = p_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\), then we get the inequality \\[\\frac{x_1 + ... + x_n}{n} \\ge \\sqrt[n]{x_1 ... x_n},\\] or \\[\\ln \\frac{x_1 + ... + x_n}{n} \\ge \\frac{\\ln x_1 + ... + \\ln x_n}{n} \\ge \\ln \\sqrt[n]{x_1 ... x_n},\\] – the classical inequality between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean of \\(n\\) numbers (\\(x_1 &gt; 0, ..., x_n &gt; 0\\)).\nFor the function \\(f(x) = -x^2\\), we get the inequality \\[(p_1x_1 + ... + p_nx_n)^2 \\le p_1x_1^2 + ... + p_nx_n^2;\\] and from it, putting \\(x_k = a_kb_k\\), \\(p_k = \\frac{b_k^2}{(b_1^2 + ... + b_n^2)}\\), we can derive the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky inequality: \\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \\le (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2),\\] according to which the scalar product of two vectors is not greater than the product of their lengths (in our proof it was important that all \\(b_k\\) are different from zero, but the last inequality is obviously true without this assumption) – see [80].\nProblem 4-19. Answer: \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\). (This area has a trapezoid, in which the lateral sides and one of the bases are equal to 1, and the other is 2.)\nLet in the quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) (which, obviously, can be considered convex) \\(AB = BC = CD = 1\\) and \\(K\\) is the midpoint of the side \\(AD\\) – see Figure 51. Completing the broken line \\(ABCD\\) symmetrically with respect to the point \\(K\\) with a three-link broken line \\(DB'C'A\\), we get a centrally symmetric hexagon, all sides of which are equal to 1. It can be divided into three rhombuses \\(ABCO, CDB'O, B'C'AO\\), and its area is equal to \\(\\sin \\alpha + \\sin \\beta + \\sin \\gamma\\), where \\(\\alpha, \\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are the angles between the segments \\(OA, OC\\), and \\(OB'\\), which add up to \\(2\\pi\\). According to the previous problem, this area is not greater than \\(3 \\sin \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), and equality is possible when \\(\\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\), i.e., when the constructed hexagon is regular.\n\\(\\nabla\\) It can be proved that the largest in area among all \\(n\\)-gons with given lengths \\(a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}\\) of consecutive sides (except for one, \\(AZ\\)) will be the one whose vertices all lie on a semicircle with diameter \\(AZ\\). This is a variant of the “Dido problem” about what is the largest area adjacent to a given line that can be enclosed by a line of a given length with ends on this line (such a line will be a semicircle).\nIf all the lengths of the sides of the \\(n\\)-gon are known, then the largest in area will be (the only one – if the order of the sides is fixed) inscribed in a circle. Accordingly, the largest area among all figures of a given perimeter is possessed by a circle (isoperimetric theorem, see [35]).\nFigure 51\nProblem 4-20. Answer: \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\).\nA convex polyhedron with 5 vertices cannot be anything other than the union of two tetrahedra (triangular pyramids) with a common base (Fig. 52). Indeed, it has such a vertex from which 4 edges emerge to all other vertices (if only 3 edges emerged from each vertex, then there would be a total of \\(5 \\cdot 3 = 15\\) ends of the edges, but each edge has two ends, so there would be \\(\\frac{15}{2}\\) edges, which is impossible). Let these vertices be \\(A, B, C, D\\), and let the edges emerge from vertex \\(E\\) to them. Then the polyhedron is the union of two tetrahedra \\(EABC\\) and \\(EBCD\\) with a common face \\(EBC\\).\nLet \\(S_{ABC}\\) be the area of triangle \\(ABC\\), and \\(h_E\\) and \\(h_D\\) be the heights of the tetrahedra \\(EABC\\) and \\(DABC\\) dropped from vertices \\(E\\) and \\(D\\) onto the plane \\(ABC\\). Then the sum of the volumes of these tetrahedra is equal to \\[\\frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} h_E + \\frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} h_D = \\frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} (h_E + h_D).\\] Similarly, if we consider the tetrahedra \\(EABD\\) and \\(ECBD\\) with a common face \\(EBD\\), then the sum of their volumes is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{3} S_{ABD} (h_E + h_C)\\). Finally, if we consider the tetrahedra \\(EADC\\) and \\(EBDC\\) with a common face \\(EDC\\), then the sum of their volumes is equal to \\(\\frac{1}{3} S_{ACD} (h_E + h_B)\\).\nThe sum of the volumes of these three pairs of tetrahedra is equal to the doubled volume of the polyhedron, so the volume of the polyhedron is equal to \\[V = \\frac{1}{6} (S_{ABC} (h_E + h_D) + S_{ABD} (h_E + h_C) + S_{ACD} (h_E + h_B)).\\] We need to find the smallest possible value of \\(V\\).\nIndeed, it has such a vertex from which 4 edges emerge to all other vertices (if only 3 edges emerged from each vertex, then there would be a total of \\(5 \\cdot 3 = 15\\) ends of edges, but this number is equal to the doubled number of all edges and should be even). If \\(AB, AD, AC\\), and \\(AE\\) are four consecutive edges of a tetrahedral angle with vertex \\(A\\), then our polyhedron is the union of tetrahedra \\(ABCD\\) and \\(ABCE\\) with a common base \\(ABC\\). Let’s estimate the volume of the polyhedron: \\[V = \\frac{S(h_D + h_E)}{3},\\] where \\(h_D\\) and \\(h_E\\) are the heights of the tetrahedra, dropped respectively from vertices \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) onto the base \\(ABC\\), \\(S\\) is the area of triangle \\(ABC\\).\nLet \\(K\\) be the intersection point of the segment \\(DE\\) with the plane \\(ABC\\); then \\(h_D + h_E \\le DK + KE = DE \\le 2\\), since the distance between any two points on a sphere is not greater than its diameter. Let \\(R\\) be the radius of the circle circumscribed around triangle \\(ABC\\) (i.e., the section of the sphere by the plane \\(ABC\\)). Then (see problem 4-18 or 4-19) \\[S \\le \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}R^2}{4} \\le \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4},\\] since the radius of any section of the sphere is not greater than the radius of the sphere. So, \\(V \\le \\frac{3}{2}\\), and \\(V = \\frac{3}{2}\\) in the case when \\(ABC\\) is a regular triangle inscribed in the equator, and \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) are the poles of the sphere.\n\\(\\nabla\\) The general problem: among all polyhedra inscribed in a sphere with \\(n\\) vertices, find the polyhedron of maximum volume – is very difficult.\nIt can be shown that for \\(n = 6\\), such a polyhedron will be a regular octahedron, but for \\(n = 8\\), the polyhedron of the largest volume will not be a cube. For the planar analogue of this problem, the situation is much simpler: the largest in area inscribed in a given circle \\(n\\)-gon for each \\(n\\) is, obviously, regular (this is a simple consequence of the convexity of the sine on the interval from 0 to \\(\\pi\\), see the discussion of problem 4-18).\nProblem 4-21. Consider unit squares centered at all the nodes of the grid that are inside a circle of radius 10 (the sides of the squares are parallel to the grid lines).\nSince the length of the diagonal of such a square is \\(\\sqrt{2} &lt; 2\\), all these squares cover a circle of radius 9, concentric with the given circle. Therefore, the sum of their areas (numerically equal to the number of grid nodes) is greater than \\(81\\pi\\) – the area of a circle of radius 9. \\(81\\pi &gt; 251\\).\n\\(\\nabla\\) We can formulate a more general problem: estimate the number of solutions in integers \\(x, y\\) of the inequality \\(x^2 + y^2 &lt; n\\) (in our problem, \\(n = 100\\)). From our reasoning, it follows that the number of solutions is not less than \\(\\pi(n-1)\\) (see [91]).\nProblem 4-22. Answer: impossible.\nLet’s draw a sphere of radius \\(R\\) centered at the given point \\(O\\). For each ray, we construct a conical surface with vertex \\(O\\), whose axis is this ray, and the angle of the generatrix with the axis is \\(30^\\circ\\); consider the “cap” – the part of the sphere lying inside this cone. The area of this “cap” (spherical segment) is equal to \\(2\\pi Rh\\), where \\(h\\) is the height of the “cap”: \\[h = R(1 - \\cos 30^\\circ) = R\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right),\\] so the ratio of the area of the “cap” to the area \\(4\\pi R^2\\) of the entire sphere is equal to \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) &gt; \\frac{1}{15}.\\] (The last inequality is equivalent to the following: \\((2 - \\sqrt{3})^{15} &gt; 4\\), \\(26 &gt; 15\\sqrt{3}\\), \\(2^{12} = 4096 &gt; 15^2 \\cdot 3 = 675\\).)\nThus, some two of the 15 “caps” corresponding to 15 rays will necessarily intersect, and therefore, some two rays form an angle less than \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\\(\\nabla\\) We can pose a more general question: what is the largest value \\(\\alpha\\) that the smallest of the angles between \\(n\\) rays emanating from one point in space can take (or, equivalently, what is the largest size that \\(n\\) identical non-intersecting “caps” on a sphere can have)? The exact answer to this question is known only for \\(n \\le 9\\) and \\(n = 12\\), although good estimates for the value of \\(\\alpha_n\\) have been obtained for many values of \\(n\\).\nProblem 4-23. Let’s mark points on the circles: on the first – \\(A\\), on the second – \\(B\\). We will specify the position of the second circle relative to the first when they are superimposed by the angular value \\(t\\) of the arc \\(AB\\), \\(0^\\circ \\le t &lt; 360^\\circ\\) (the count goes counterclockwise).\nLet’s call the value of \\(t\\) forbidden if, with the corresponding arrangement of the circles, at least one pair of marked arcs intersects.\nConsider some arc of \\(25^\\circ\\) and some arc of \\(30^\\circ\\). They intersect on some interval of values of \\(t\\) of magnitude \\(55^\\circ\\). In total, there are no more such forbidden segments than pairs of arcs, i.e., \\(3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\). Therefore, the set of forbidden values of \\(t\\) has a total value of no more than \\(6 \\cdot 55^\\circ = 330^\\circ\\) and does not cover the entire set of values of \\(t\\) – from \\(0^\\circ\\) to \\(360^\\circ\\).\nThis means that there are also non-forbidden values of \\(t\\) for which no pair of arcs intersects.\n\\(\\nabla\\) Similarly, it can be proved that if non-overlapping arcs \\(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ..., \\alpha_m\\) are marked on one unit circle, and arcs \\(\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_n\\) are marked on the other, and \\[m(\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + ... + \\alpha_m) + n(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + ... + \\beta_n) &lt; 360^\\circ,\\] then the circles can be aligned so that the marked arcs do not intersect.\nAn interesting and in some sense “reverse” question is: under what conditions on the numbers \\(\\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_m, \\beta_1, ..., \\beta_n\\) is it possible to arrange the corresponding arcs so that some arcs overlap for any superposition of the circles?\nNote also that the method of our solution to problem 4-23 can be called a continuous analogue of the Dirichlet principle (see problem 2-9); and they have a common drawback: this method does not show how to find the required method of superposition.\nProblem 4-24. Let’s carry out the weighing of the weights in three stages.\nAt stage 1, we made three weighings, at stages 2 and 3 – two weighings each, i.e., a total of 7 weighings.\n\\(\\nabla\\) We will prove that it is impossible to order 5 weights in less than 7 weighings. Indeed, there are a total of \\(5! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 120\\) options for ordering five weights. Each weighing has two outcomes. Therefore, \\(p\\) weighings can make a choice of no more than \\(2^p\\) options. (In the worst case for us, after the next weighing, the number of possible options is reduced by no more than half.) Therefore, in order for 5 weights to be ordered in \\(p\\) weighings, the inequality \\(2^p \\ge 120\\) must be satisfied, or \\(p \\ge \\log_2 120\\), whence \\(p \\ge 7\\).\nIn the general case, to order \\(n\\) weights, at least \\(\\log_2(n!)\\) weighings are definitely needed.\nThe general problem of the minimum number \\(F(n)\\) of weighings for which \\(n\\) weights can be ordered is far from being completely solved and is of great interest to programming specialists.\nSeveral general methods for ordering \\(n\\) weights have been invented, but for large \\(n\\), the number of weighings in all these methods exceeds \\([\\log_2(n!)] + 1\\). The simplest of them is the so-called “binary insertion” algorithm. At the \\(k\\)-th stage of this algorithm (\\(k = 1, 2, ..., n-1\\)), some new \\((k+1)\\)-th weight is taken and its place is found among the chain of already ordered \\(k\\) weights. First, it is compared in mass with the weight standing in the middle of this chain, then – with the weight in the middle of the half of the chain in which it turned out to be, and so on. At the \\(k\\)-th stage, no more than \\([\\log_2 k] + 1\\) weighings are spent. Thus, we can order \\(n\\) weights in no more than \\[(1 + \\log_2 2) + (1 + \\log_2 3) + ... + (1 + \\log_2(n-1)) &lt; n(1 + \\log_2 n)\\] weighings.\nSo, the minimum number \\(F(n)\\) of weighings satisfies the inequalities \\[\\log_2(n!) \\le F(n) &lt; n(1 + \\log_2 n).\\] Only for \\(n \\le 4\\) does the “binary insertion” algorithm give the correct values of \\(F(n)\\): \\(F(2) = 1\\), \\(F(3) = 3\\), \\(F(4) = 5\\). For the case \\(n = 5\\), it requires 8, not \\(F(5) = 7\\) weighings. A generalization of the weighing method that was indicated in the solution to the problem about five weights (the “insertion and merge” sorting algorithm [94]) gives the smallest possible number \\(F(n)\\) of weighings for \\(n \\le 12\\) and \\(n = 20, 21\\), but it (as V.S. Grinberg told us) is not optimal for all \\(n\\).",

    "text": "6.1 Problems Discussion\nProblem 6-1. a) Answer: 8.\nLet’s start dividing 1 by 7 “by corner” and we will see that the sequence of digits of the quotient after the decimal point will be periodic with a period of 6 digits: (142857). Since 100 = 6 ⋅ 16 + 4, the fourth digit of the period – the digit 8 – will be in the 100th place after the decimal point.\n∇ For any natural numbers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), the fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) is represented either by a finite decimal fraction or by an infinite periodic decimal fraction. Indeed, dividing \\(p\\) by \\(q\\) “by corner”, we will get the remainders when dividing some natural numbers by \\(q\\). The remainder when dividing by \\(q\\) can be a non-negative integer less than \\(q\\). Therefore, after no more than \\(q\\) divisions, either some next remainder will be zero and we will get a finite decimal fraction, or some two remainders will coincide and from this place the quotients will be periodically repeated. This reasoning uses the Dirichlet principle, which was discussed in the discussion of problem 2-9.\nIndeed, multiplying this number by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we get the numbers 285714, 428571, 571428, 714285, and 857142, respectively.\n∇ The answer in problem b) is the number made up of the digits of the period of the expansion of the number 1/7 into a decimal fraction. The five numbers written out are, in turn, the periods of the expansion of the numbers 2/7, 3/7, 4/7, 5/7, 6/7 into a decimal fraction. This is easy to verify when dividing the number 1 by 7 by corner: from the second step we divide 3 by 7, starting from the third step – 2 by 7, then – 6, 4, and 5.\nProblem 6-2. Answer: 127 geese.\nLet one more goose, the Gray Goose, fly with the flock of white geese all the time. If \\(m\\) white geese and the Gray Goose fly up to a certain lake, then \\(\\frac{m}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{m+1}{2}\\) – exactly half of all geese – land on this lake. Therefore, after each lake, the number of flying geese is halved. After seven lakes, it decreases by \\(2^7 = 128\\) times, and one Gray Goose remains flying. This means that there were 128 geese in the beginning, of which 127 were white.\n∇ The Gray Goose appeared in the solution of the problem not by chance. Let \\(x_k\\) denote the number of flying white geese when there are still \\(k\\) lakes ahead. Then the condition of the problem is written as follows: \\(x_{k-1} = \\frac{x_k}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\). From here we get a recurrence relation for the sequence \\((x_n)\\): \\(x_k = 2x_{k-1} + 1\\).\nAdding the Gray Goose, we essentially made a change of variable: \\(y_n = x_n + 1\\) and got a new sequence \\((y_n)\\). Substituting \\(x_k = y_k - 1\\) and \\(x_{k-1} = y_{k-1} - 1\\) into the relation (*), we see that the sequence \\((y_k)\\) satisfies a simpler relation: \\(y_k = 2 y_{k-1}\\). \\((y_k)\\) is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2, and, therefore, its general term has the form \\(y_n = 2^n y_0\\). Returning to the sequence \\((x_n)\\), we find the formula for its general term: \\(x_n = 2^n - 1\\).\nNow consider a more general case of the sequence \\((x_n)\\), given by the relation\n\\(x_k = q x_{k-1} + d\\). (**)\nIf \\(q = 1\\), then \\((x_n)\\) is an arithmetic progression and its general term is given by the formula \\(x_n = x_0 + d(n-1)\\).\nIf \\(q \\ne 1\\) and \\(d = 0\\), then \\((x_n)\\) is a geometric progression and \\(x_n = q^n x_0\\). If \\(q \\ne 1\\) and \\(d \\ne 0\\), then we are looking for such \\(z\\) that the sequence \\(y_n = x_n + z\\) becomes a geometric progression. Substituting \\(x_k = y_k - z\\) and \\(x_{k-1} = y_{k-1} - z\\) into the relation (**), we get:\n\\(y_k = q y_{k-1} + z(1-q) + d\\). If we choose \\(z\\) so that \\(z(1-q) + d = 0\\), then \\(y_k = q y_{k-1}\\), whence \\(y_n = q^n y_0\\). Thus, the formula for the general term is found: \\(x_n = q^n (x_0 + z) - z\\), where \\(z = \\frac{d}{1-q}\\). In our problem, \\(q = 2\\), \\(x_0 = 0\\), \\(d = 1\\), and \\(z = 1\\) (one Gray Goose).\nProblem 6-3. Answer: \\(a_{1986} = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\nLet’s write out the first terms of this sequence:\n2, 3, 3/2, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 2, 3, …\nSince the two adjacent terms \\(a_7\\) and \\(a_8\\) are the same as \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\), and each subsequent term is calculated from the two previous ones, the sequence will repeat with a period of 6. Since 1986 is divisible by 6, then \\(a_{1986} = a_6 = \\frac{2}{3}\\).\n∇ In general, for any non-zero first two terms \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\), the sequence from problem 6-2 repeats with a period of 6, i.e., \\(a_{n+6} = a_n\\). To verify this, it is sufficient to write out the first eight terms of the sequence:\n\\(a_1, a_2, a_1a_2, 1, a_1, 1/a_2, a_1a_2, 1, a_1, ...\\)\nIt is convenient to denote \\(\\ln a_n\\) by \\(x_n\\), then the sequence \\((x_n)\\) will satisfy the condition: \\(x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} - x_n\\) (for \\(n \\ge 1\\)) and, of course, will also be periodic with a period of 6. A more general fact is true: if\n\\[d = 2 \\cos \\frac{k\\pi}{m},\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) (\\(k &lt; m\\)) are coprime natural numbers, then the sequence for which \\(x_{n+2} = dx_{n+1} - x_n\\) is periodic with a period of \\(2m\\). For \\(k = 1, m = 3\\), we get\n\\[d = 2 \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{3} = 1\\]\nand the period of the sequence is equal to \\(2m = 6\\).\nProblem 6-4. Answer: The same amount as was initially - \\(A\\) liters of water in each.\nTo verify this, we will show that after every two subsequent transfers, the amount of water remains the same. When \\(\\frac{1}{k}\\)-th part of the water from another container is added to a container, it becomes\n\\[A \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k} \\right) = A \\frac{k+1}{k} \\text{ liters.}\\]\nAfter this, when \\(\\frac{1}{k+1}\\)-th part is poured out of it, it becomes\n\\[A \\frac{k+1}{k} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k+1} \\right) = A \\frac{k+1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{k}{k+1} = A \\text{ liters.}\\]\nProblem 6-5. Note that if the first container had \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) liters and the second had \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) liters, then after the first transfer, the volumes would have swapped places, and after the second transfer, they would have become the same as at the beginning.\nWe will count from such a state. Let after an even number of transfers, the first container has \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3} + p \\right)\\) liters, where \\(-\\frac{1}{6} \\le p \\le \\frac{1}{6}\\), then the second container will have \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3} - p \\right)\\) liters of water. After the next transfer, these containers will have respectively \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{p}{2} \\right)\\) liters and \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{p}{2} \\right)\\) liters of water, and then \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{p}{4} \\right)\\) liters and \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{p}{4} \\right)\\) liters.\nSo, after every two transfers, the addition \\(p\\) decreases by a factor of 4. This means that after 100 transfers (50 pairs of transfers), the addition \\(p\\) will decrease by a factor of \\(4^{50}\\) and the containers will have: \\(\\frac{2}{3} + p \\cdot \\frac{1}{4^{50}}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3} - p \\cdot \\frac{1}{4^{50}}\\) liters. Since the addition \\(p\\) satisfies the inequality \\(-\\frac{1}{6} \\le p \\le \\frac{1}{6}\\), the addition \\(p \\cdot \\frac{1}{4^{50}}\\) is less than \\(\\frac{1}{10000}\\) and thus the containers will have, with high accuracy, \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) liters and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) liters.\n∇ If you pour not half, but \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\)-th part of the water each time, then after 100 transfers, with high accuracy, the containers will have \\(\\frac{n}{2n-1}\\) and \\(\\frac{n-1}{2n-1}\\) liters of water, respectively.\nLet’s show how to find this answer. If the first container has \\(x\\) liters of water and the second container has \\(y\\) liters of water, then after the first transfer, the first container will have \\(x\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right) + \\frac{y}{n} = x\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right) + \\frac{y}{n}\\) liters. For the amount in the first container to be \\(x\\) again after the second transfer, the following relation must hold: \\(y = x\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right)\\). Since \\(x+y=1\\), we get \\(x = \\frac{n}{2n-1}\\) liters, \\(y = \\frac{n-1}{2n-1}\\) liters.\nProblem 6-6. Answer: 9.\nIf a number is divisible by 9, then the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9. Since \\(3^{1986} = 9 \\cdot 3^{1984}\\), all terms of the given sequence are divisible by 9.\nLet’s estimate their values. From the inequality \\(3^4 &lt; 10^2\\) it follows that \\(3^{1986} &lt; 10^{993}\\), therefore the number \\(3^{1986}\\) has no more than 993 digits. This means that the second term of the sequence is no more than \\(9 \\cdot 993 &lt; 10^4\\), i.e., it has no more than four digits. Then the third term of the sequence is no more than \\(9 \\cdot 4 = 36\\), and the fourth is less than 18. Since the fourth term, like the previous ones, is divisible by 9, it is equal to 9. And this means that all subsequent terms are equal to 9.\n∇ In general, in a sequence of natural numbers where the \\(n\\)-th term is the sum of the digits of the \\((n-1)\\)-th term, all terms, starting from some point, are the same and equal to the remainder \\(r\\) when the first term is divided by 9 (if \\(r \\ne 0\\)) or 9 (if \\(r = 0\\)).\nProblem 6-7. Consider the number of pairs of gnome friends whose houses are of different colors. Every month, their number does not increase. Indeed, if the next gnome paints the house the same color as it was before, then this number remains the same; if he paints it a different color, then it will decrease. Since this whole number is non-negative, it cannot decrease all the time, which means that starting from some moment it will not change. From this moment on, each gnome will always paint his house the same color.\n∇ Note that in the problem statement, the oddness of the number of friends for each gnome is only needed to make it clear what the majority is, and the number of gnomes can be replaced by any other even number. The following technique helped us solve this problem: find a quantity (the number of pairs of friends with different colored houses) that remains the same or decreases under the operation specified in the condition. This technique often helps to understand what happens when an operation is repeated many times on a certain set.\nProblem 6-8. Let’s draw a horizontal line through the top side of the topmost sick cell. It is clear that no cell located above this line will get sick. Similarly, no cell to the right of the rightmost initially sick cell will get sick. Thus, all the cells that may get sick lie inside some right angle. Consider the diagonal farthest from the vertex of the angle, perpendicular to the bisector of this angle, on which sick cells still lie. It is clear that all sick cells lying on it will recover in an hour. Thus, each hour the diagonal farthest from the vertex, containing sick cells, “steps” towards the vertex of the angle. Consequently, at some point it will reach the vertex of the angle, inside which sick cells may lie. This means that all cells have recovered.\nFor experts. Let each cell on the plane be able to be in two states, 0 and 1 (or in one of a finite number N of states), and at each moment of time t = 1, 2, 3, … it takes one of these states, depending on the states of several of its neighbors, according to a certain rule F, the same for all neighbors. Such systems, called cellular automata, have been intensively studied in the last decade by physicists, computer designers, and mathematicians. For some relatively simple rules (such as, for example, the rules of the game “Life” by J. Conway - see [74]), the cellular automaton has a remarkably complex behavior. This applies not only to two-dimensional, but also to one-dimensional (located on the integer line) cellular automata. They are widely studied using computer simulation; even special programs have been built that allow you to observe the behavior of a cellular automaton on a display screen.\nFew mathematical results related to cellular automata have been obtained so far. For some problems related to them, their algorithmic undecidability has been proven; for example, for the game “Life” there is no algorithm that allows you to find out from the initial configuration of a finite number of units whether it will turn into an empty configuration “all zeros” after some time.\nProblem 6-9. Let’s associate a broken line on graph paper with a row of soldiers, the lines of which go at an angle of 45° to the horizontal line, as shown in Figure 78a: each soldier corresponds to the next segment of the broken line, and if the soldier looks to the right, then the corresponding segment of the broken line goes up, and if to the left, then down. The changes that occur in the row of soldiers in the next second can now be described as follows: the ends A and B of the broken line do not move, and each corner of two adjacent segments sticking up (“hill”) turns into a corner sticking down (“pit”). Thus, the height of the highest “hill” decreases every second, and this will continue until there are no “hills” left in the broken line, i.e., it turns into a broken line AOB from two sides of the rectangle AOBC (see Figure 78b).\nThe maximum number of seconds during which movement can occur in a row of N soldiers is equal to N – 1: this will be the case if the initial position corresponds to the broken line ACB, and for any other broken line with the same end vertices, the time to complete stop will be less.\n∇ If in an infinite row almost all soldiers are turned to the left and only a finite set are looking to the right, then the movement according to the rule specified in the problem will continue indefinitely - a wave that retains its shape moves along the row.\nIt is interesting that there are rules that are the same for all soldiers, symmetrical with respect to replacing “left” with “right” and require only dependence on three neighbors, which allow you to correct any finite defect in an infinite row. Here is one of them. Let each soldier who sees that the first and third soldiers in front of him (on the side he is looking at) are facing him turn his back to them, then after a finite period of time the movement in any row with a “finite defect” will stop (see [53]).\nProblem 6-10. a) Answer: (3, 2, 1).\nFigure 79 shows a diagram. It depicts all possible types of entries in the register for n = 6. An arrow leading from one entry to another shows that the second entry will necessarily follow the first one. We see that no later than the seventh day, the entry (3, 2, 1) will be in the register every day.\nThis answer can be obtained by constructing a diagram similar to the one shown in Figure 79. Those who wish can draw it themselves (it contains 42 entries) and see that no later than the thirteenth day, the entry (4, 3, 2, 1) will be in the register every day.\n∇ In principle, a similar diagram can be drawn for any given n, although for large n this requires a lot of time. However, it turns out that, without doing a complete enumeration, it is possible to find out which entries will appear in the register after a sufficiently long time. The general result can be formulated as follows. If the number of volumes n can be written as the sum of consecutive natural numbers, starting from 1, i.e., \\(n = 1 + 2 + ... + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\) for some k, then, starting from some day, the entry (k, k-1, k-2, …, 2, 1) will be repeated in the register all the time. (In problem 6-10 a) and b) it was like this: \\(6 = \\frac{3 \\cdot 4}{2}\\), \\(10 = \\frac{4 \\cdot 5}{2}\\).) If the number n is not represented in the form \\(\\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\), then the register “loops”: the entries in it begin to repeat with a period of k such that \\(\\frac{(k-1)k}{2} &lt; n &lt; \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\).\nThe following construction helps to prove this result and, in addition, to find out what the cycles will be for \\(n \\ne \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\). Consider the first coordinate quarter with a coordinate grid applied to it. We will depict the entry in the register (k, k, …, k), where \\(k_1 \\ge k_2 \\ge k_3 \\ge ... \\ge k_l\\), as follows. Let’s blacken a column of height \\(k_1\\) in the figure, next to it - a column of height \\(k_2\\), then - of height \\(k_3\\), and so on, up to a column of height \\(k_l\\) (Fig. 80).\nIt is convenient to perform the procedure that the official performs on our drawing as follows.\nFirst stage. Cut off the bottom row from the black figure, shift what is left one cell to the right and down, rotate the cut off part by 90° counterclockwise (turn the cut off row into the first column).\nSecond stage. If the new first column is not the tallest (lower than the second), then cut off and move from right to left those black squares for which there is free space on the left. At the end of the second stage, the columns are arranged in ascending order.\nLet’s assume that each black cell has two integer coordinates: the column number and the row number in which it stands.\nMain idea. When the first stage is performed, the sum of the coordinates of each black cell does not change, and when the second stage is performed, it decreases for the moved cells. Now consider the sum of both coordinates of all black cells. This sum does not change in the first stage and decreases in the second. From this it follows that the second stage can be repeated only a finite number of times (the sum of the coordinates of the cells is an integer and a positive number, so it cannot decrease indefinitely). This means that, starting from some moment, only the first stage will occur. Consequently, the sum of coordinates will be constant for each cell. From this moment on, each cell (x; y) will move along the cycle (1; q − 1) → (2; q − 2) → … → (q − 1; 1) → (1; q − 1), which we will call the q-diagonal.\nMoreover, only the last longest diagonal can be unfilled. In fact, since the second stages no longer occur, the black squares “walk” cyclically along the q-diagonal with a period of q. The periods in the q-th and (q − 1)-th diagonals differ by one. Therefore, it cannot happen that there are empty cells in the (q − 1)-th diagonal, and in the q-th diagonal, sooner or later, it would be to the right of the empty cell and the second stage would have to be carried out.\nSo, empty spaces can only be on the last diagonal. If \\(n = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\), then all the diagonals are filled; if \\(n \\ne \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\\), then, obviously, there will be cycles.\nStepped figures made up of squares, as well as numerical tables of this form, made up of numbers 1, 2, …, n, help to solve many problems of combinatorics and algebra related to counting the partitions of a natural number into natural terms, the theory of representations of the permutation group, etc. They have a special name - Young diagrams.\nThe problem is known to mathematicians under the name “Bulgarian Solitaire” or “Bulgarian Patience”. As far as we know, the solution given in the text of our book belongs to A. Toom (1981), then (another) solution was published in 1982. It became more widely known thanks to the famous popularizer of mathematics M. Gardner (see [134]). Comprehensive information on this issue can be found in [135] - [137].\nProblem 6-11. Answer: 144 numbers.\nLet’s divide all ten-digit numbers that satisfy the condition into two groups. The first group will include those numbers that end in 5, and the second group will include those that end in 2.\nBy crossing out the last digit 5 for all numbers from the first group, we get all nine-digit numbers in which no two twos are next to each other.\nBy crossing out the last two digits - 52 - for all numbers from the second group, we get all eight-digit numbers in which no two twos are next to each other.\nLet’s denote the number of n-digit numbers consisting of digits 2 and 5, in which no two twos are next to each other, by \\(a_n\\).\nOur reasoning shows that \\(a_{10} = a_9 + a_8\\).\nNote that it is suitable for any \\(n \\ge 3\\), i.e., \\(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\\).\nSince \\(a_1 = 2\\), \\(a_2 = 3\\), then according to this formula \\(a_3 = 5\\), \\(a_4 = 8\\), \\(a_5 = 13\\), etc., \\(a_{10} = 144\\).\n∇ The sequence \\(a_n\\) is simply the Fibonacci sequence \\((F_n)\\) 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, … numbered from the third term, i.e., \\(a_n = F_{n+2}\\) - see the discussion of problem 2-4, b).\nFor recurrent sequences, where the general term is given by a linear function of several previous ones, there is a standard procedure that allows you to find an explicit formula that defines the term of such a sequence as a function of its number. Let’s demonstrate it on the Fibonacci sequence.\nWe are looking for a geometric progression \\(u_k = a\\lambda^k\\) that satisfies the relation \\(u_{n+1} = u_n + u_{n-1}\\). We get the equation \\(\\lambda^2 = \\lambda + 1\\). We find its roots: \\(\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\). Thus, we get two geometric progressions of the form \\(b(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})^n\\) and \\(c(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2})^n\\). For the sequence obtained by their term-by-term addition, the relation \\(u_{n+1} = u_n + u_{n-1}\\) also holds. Now we find b and c so that the formula\n\\(u_n = b(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})^n + c(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2})^n\\)\nworks for the initial terms \\(u_1, u_2\\).\nFor the Fibonacci sequence \\(u_1 = u_2 = 1\\), from which\n\\(b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}, c = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\).\nFor the sequence \\((a_n)\\) from problem 6-11, we get\n\\(a_n = F_{n+2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}[(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})^{n+2} - (\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2})^{n+2}]\\).\nAfter 32 people leave the circle, 32 people will remain in it, and the count will start again from the first one.\nThe same thing will happen again: another 16 people will leave and the count will start again from the first one. Going around the circle a few more times, we are convinced that the first one will remain.\nAs we can see from the solution to part a), if there are \\(2^n\\) people in the circle, the first one (the one from whom the count starts) will remain until the end. Let there be 1986 people in the circle. We’ll go around the circle, removing every other person, and stop at the moment when 962 people have left the circle. At this moment, there will remain\n\\(1986 - 962 = 1024 = 2^{10}\\) kids, and the first of the remaining ones has the number \\(2 \\cdot 962 + 1 = 1925\\). He will remain in the circle until the end.\n∇ For the general problem - when there are N kids in the circle - the number of the remaining one can be elegantly determined using the binary number system: you need to write the number N in binary and move the first digit (one) to the end. The result will be the binary representation of the sought “leader’s” number.\nFor example: a) \\(64_{10} = 1000000_2 \\rightarrow 0000001_2 = 1_{10}\\); b) \\(1986_{10} = 11111000010_2 \\rightarrow 11110000101_2 = 1925_{10}\\).\nIt would be interesting to find a solution to a similar general problem when every m-th person leaves the circle (at the end, (m-1) people remain) (see [94], ex. 1.3.2-22 and 5.1.1-2).\nProblem 6-13. a) Answer: 0.\nFor convenience, let’s write: \\(\\overline{0} = 1\\) and \\(\\overline{1} = 0\\).\nLet’s denote the (n+1)-th term of the constructed sequence as \\(x_n\\): \\(x_0 = 0\\), \\(x_1 = 1\\), \\(x_2 = 1\\), … We need to find \\(x_{1986}\\).\nAt each step of constructing the sequence, its length doubles. Let’s figure out at which step the term \\(x_{1986}\\) will appear.\nAfter 10 steps, we’ll get \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) terms of the sequence, so we need to make 11 steps. On the 11th step, we should append the same terms that were before and replace 0 with 1, and 1 with 0, therefore, \\(x_{1986} = \\overline{x_{962}}\\) (\\(1986 - 1024 = 962\\)).\nReasoning in the same way, we’ll find that \\(x_{962} = x_{450}\\) (\\(962 - 2^9 = 450\\)), and so on. As a result, we get a chain of equalities\n\\(x_{1986} = \\overline{x_{962}} = \\overline{x_{450}} = \\overline{x_{194}} = \\overline{x_{66}} = \\overline{x_2} = \\overline{x_0} = 0\\).\n∇ When solving problem 6-13 a), we actually used this property of the given sequence:\n1°. \\(x_n = \\overline{x_{n-2^k}}\\), where \\(2^k \\leq n &lt; 2^{k+1}\\).\nAnother solution to this problem can be obtained based on the following properties of our sequence, which will also be used in solving problem b): for all n\n2°. \\(x_{2n} = x_n\\); 3°. \\(x_{2n+1} = \\overline{x_{2n}}\\).\nTo prove this, note that the sequence can be constructed according to a new rule: first, there is a pair (0; 1), then a pair (1; 0) is added to it, then two pairs: (1; 0), (0; 1), and so on: at each step, the same number of new pairs is added to the existing pairs, which are obtained from the old ones by replacing each pair (0; 1) with a pair (1; 0), and (1; 0) with (0; 1).\nNow suppose that the given sequence is periodic and \\(k\\) is the length of its smallest period.\nLet first \\(k = 2p\\) be an even number. Then the periodicity of the sequence means that there exists a natural number \\(N\\) such that for all \\(n \\ge N\\) the equality \\(x_n = x_{n+2p}\\) holds. But from the new rule it follows that if we divide our sequence into pairs \\((x_0, x_1); (x_2, x_3), ..., (x_{2n}, x_{2n+1}), ...\\), then the first terms of all pairs form the sequence \\(x_0, x_2, x_4, ..., x_{2n}, ...\\), which coincides with the original one (property 2°). From here we get \\(x_n = x_{2n} = x_{2n+2p} = x_{2(n+p)} = x_{n+p}\\), i.e., the sequence has a period \\(p\\), which contradicts the fact that \\(2p\\) is the smallest period.\nNow let \\(k = 2p + 1\\) be an odd number. Then in a piece of the sequence of length \\(k\\) there is a different number of zeros and ones. Suppose that the number of ones is greater - at least \\(p + 1\\) (the case when the number of zeros is greater is considered similarly).\nConsider a piece of the sequence of length \\(2k\\). It contains at least \\(2p + 2\\) ones, and no more than \\(2p\\) zeros, i.e., there are at least 2 more ones. But from the new rule it follows that \\(x_{2n+1} = \\overline{x_{2n}}\\) (property 3°). Therefore, in any piece of our sequence starting with \\(x_{2^m}\\), the number of ones differs from the number of zeros by no more than one. This means that the sequence is non-periodic.\n∇ This sequence is called the Morse sequence and is often found in various areas of mathematics (see problem 6-18).\nIts general term can be defined as follows: if the notation of the number \\(n\\) in the binary number system contains an even number of ones, then \\(x_n = 0\\); if it is odd, then \\(x_n = 1\\).\nA similar sequence is obtained from the triple 001, if you do not double, but triple the pieces:\n001 001 110 001 001 110 110 110 001…\nThis sequence is called the “waltz of infinite order”, and, glancing over it, you can, as it were, hear the melody of the waltz.\nInterest in such sequences is associated, in particular, with Kolmogorov’s complexity theory. Both given sequences, being by no means random, have some properties required from tables of random numbers. Thus, the proportion of ones among the first \\(k\\) terms of each of these two sequences tends to one-half as \\(k \\rightarrow \\infty\\) (see [138]).\nThe considered sequence was first constructed in 1851 by Prouhet (P. Prouhet), who applied it in number theory, but limited himself to these applications, without touching on many interesting, unique properties of this sequence.\nIn 1906, Axel Thue, who was engaged in combinatorics, rediscovered this sequence, but his work did not receive wide response and recognition.\nIn 1921, Marston Morse, who was engaged in differential geometry, rediscovered this sequence again.\nSince then, it has been rediscovered independently many times. Interestingly, the world chess champion grandmaster Max Euwe discovered its application in chess. He showed how to play endlessly without breaking the rules of a draw. However, there are some subtleties associated with chess rules (see the book [140]).\nThe Morse-Thue sequence is the simplest example of a fractal. Therefore, it has a number of symmetries, in particular, it does not change when all elements in even places are removed.\nAmong its other properties, we note that it does not contain three identical pieces in a row, i.e., it is impossible to meet the fragment AAA in it, where A is any finite sequence of zeros and ones.\nThere is a number \\(\\tau\\), the binary notation of which is the Morse-Thue sequence, it is called the Prouhet-Thue-Morse number;\n\\[\\tau = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{t_i}{2^{i+1}} = 0.412454033640...,\\]\nwhere \\(t_i\\) are the elements of the Morse-Thue sequence. As K. Mahler proved in 1929, this number is transcendental, i.e., it is not a root of any polynomial with integer coefficients.\nGeneralizations of the Morse-Thue sequence are also considered both to an arbitrary alphabet (i.e., instead of zeros and ones, one can consider n arbitrary symbols) and to the multidimensional case (for example, a two-dimensional sequence is a matrix obtained from the previous transformation \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\), see [139]).\nProblem 6-14. Answer: Either A had the number 20 and B had the number 21, or A had the number 21 and B had the number 22.\nThe following table explains what conclusions an intelligent viewer (for example, you and I) can draw, and what A and B drew based on each replica (replicas are given in abbreviated form).\n∇ In solving this problem, we used considerations like “A thinks that B thinks that…”. Such multiple reflections of reality in the minds of people (similar to multiple reflections in mirrors) have recently attracted the attention of scientists and are discussed under the name “reflexive reflections” (the Latin word reflexus means “reflected”)2.\nAmong the mathematical problems involving reflexive reasoning, let’s name a series of problems “about wise men with dirty foreheads” (see, for example, [55]).\nProblem 6-15. Consider the mapping \\(f\\) that maps the large map \\(K_0\\) to the smaller map \\(K_1\\); each point representing a certain point on the map \\(K_0\\) ( \\(K_0 \\supset K_1\\) ) is mapped to the point representing the same point on the map \\(K_1\\). Let’s denote by \\(K_2\\) the image of the map \\(K_1\\) under the same mapping (Fig. 81) \\(f(K_{n-1}) = K_n\\), \\(n = 1, 2, ...\\). The rectangles \\(K_0\\), \\(K_1\\), \\(K_2\\), …, \\(K_n\\), … have exactly one common point \\(x\\), since the sizes of the rectangles tend to zero.\nThe point \\(x\\) is the desired puncture point. Indeed, the fact that \\(x \\in K_{n-1}\\) implies that \\(f(x) \\in K_n\\) (for any \\(n\\)). Thus, the point \\(f(x)\\) also belongs to all rectangles, and there is only one such point, so \\(x = f(x)\\).\n∇ In general, the following theorem is true: any continuous mapping of a rectangle into itself has a fixed point. So the statement of problem 6-15 will remain true even if one map is crumpled and placed on another map (see [30, 44, 98]).\nAnother approach is possible to our problem (when the map is not crumpled). You can imagine a smaller map as obtained from a larger one using a geometric transformation of the composition of homothety and rotation. If the plane on which the maps lie is represented as a complex plane, then such a transformation is represented by a linear function \\(w(z) = qz + b\\), where \\(q\\), \\(b\\), \\(z\\) are complex numbers and \\(q \\ne 0, 1\\).\nThen the fixed point \\(z_0\\) is found as a solution to the equation \\(z = qz + b\\), i.e., \\(z_0 = \\frac{b}{1-q}\\).\nProblem 6-16. Answer: The limit is equal to \\(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\).\nThe given sequence \\((a_n)\\) is defined by the conditions \\(a_1 = 1\\), \\(a_{n+1} = 1 + \\frac{1}{a_n}\\).\nFirst, let’s assume that it has a limit \\(\\tau\\). Since \\(\\lim a_n = \\lim a_{n+1} = \\tau\\), we pass to the limit in the equality \\(a_{n+1} = 1 + \\frac{1}{a_n}\\) and get \\(\\tau = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\). Squaring both sides of the resulting equality, we arrive at the quadratic equation \\(\\tau^2 - \\tau - 1 = 0\\) with the condition that \\(\\tau &gt; 0\\). The roots of this equation will be the numbers \\(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\), and, consequently, \\(\\tau = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\).\nNow let’s prove that the sequence \\((a_n)\\) is monotonically increasing and all its terms are no greater than the number \\(\\tau\\); from this, according to the Weierstrass theorem, it will follow that it has a limit. We will carry out the proof by induction.\nBase of induction: \\(a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \\tau\\), i.e. \\(1 &lt; 1 + \\frac{1}{1} &lt; \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\). Here, both inequalities can be checked by term-by-term squaring.\nNow let’s do the induction step: suppose that \\(a_{k-1} &lt; a_k &lt; \\tau\\), and prove that \\(a_k &lt; a_{k+1} &lt; \\tau\\).\nThe inequality \\(a_k &lt; a_{k+1}\\) is equivalent to the inequality \\(1 + \\frac{1}{a_{k-1}} &lt; 1 + \\frac{1}{a_k}\\). The last inequality is true, since according to the induction hypothesis \\(a_{k-1} &lt; a_k\\).\nThe inequality \\(a_{k+1} &lt; \\tau\\), or \\(1 + \\frac{1}{a_k} &lt; \\tau\\), is equivalent to the inequality \\(a_k &lt; \\tau^2 - 1\\). Since \\(\\tau^2 - \\tau - 1 = 0\\), then \\(\\tau^2 - 1 = \\tau\\) and, consequently, \\(a_k &lt; \\tau\\).\nThe proof by induction is completed.\n∇ Note that we denoted the limit by the Greek letter \\(\\tau\\) (tau), since it is customary to denote the remarkable number \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\\) in this way (see problem 3-14).\nIf we consider the function \\(f(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\), then the sequence from problem 6-16 can be thought of as the sequence \\(f(0)\\), \\(f(f(0))\\), \\(f(f(f(0)))\\), …\nThe behavior of sequences of the form \\(x_0\\), \\(f(x_0)\\), \\(f(f(x_0))\\), \\(f(f(f(x_0)))\\), … is conveniently studied graphically. The graph of the function \\(y = f(x)\\) and the line \\(y = x\\) are drawn in one coordinate system. Then our sequence corresponds to the geometric procedure shown in Figure 82.\nFrom the point \\(M_0 = (x_0, 0)\\) on the \\(Ox\\) axis, we draw a vertical line until it intersects the graph of the function \\(y = f(x)\\). The intersection point has coordinates \\(N_0 = (x_0, f(x_0))\\). From this point we draw a horizontal line until it intersects the line \\(y = x\\) at the point \\(M_1 = (f(x_0), f(x_0))\\). From this point, we again draw a vertical line until it intersects the graph of the function \\(y = f(x)\\) at the point \\(N_1 = (f(x_0), f(f(x_0)))\\), and so on. The abscissas of the points \\(N_0, N_1, ...\\) (or the ordinates of the points \\(M_0, M_1, ...\\)) are the terms of our sequence.\nFigure 82 shows the graph of the function \\(f(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\) from problem 6-16. We see that the terms of the sequence grow and tend to the number \\(\\tau\\), where \\(\\tau\\) is the abscissa of the intersection point of the graph of the function \\(f(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\) with the line \\(y = x\\).\nBy calculating one after another the terms of this sequence using the formula \\(x_{n+1} = 1 + \\frac{1}{x_n}\\), starting with \\(x_0 = 0\\), we thereby find with ever greater accuracy the root \\(\\tau\\) of the equation \\(x^2 - x - 1 = 0\\). This observation explains the following technique for the approximate solution of equations. The equation \\(F(x) = 0\\) is rewritten in the form \\(x = f(x)\\). A number \\(x_0\\) is chosen and the terms of the sequence \\(x_n\\) are found one after another using the formula \\(x_{n+1} = f(x_n)\\) for \\(n \\ge 1\\). This method of finding the roots of an equation is called the iteration method or the method of successive approximations (see [44, 64]).\nProblem 6-17. Answer: \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\\).\nNote that all terms \\(a_k\\) of the sequence are positive and that the number \\(\\tau = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}\\) is the root of the equation \\(\\frac{1}{\\tau} = 1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\). Let’s show that if \\(a_k &lt; \\tau\\), then \\(a_{k+1} &gt; \\tau\\) and \\(a_{k+2} &lt; \\tau\\).\nThe inequality \\(a_k &lt; \\tau\\) implies the following relations:\n\\[\\frac{1}{a_k} &gt; \\frac{1}{\\tau}, \\quad a_{k+1} = 1 + \\frac{1}{a_k} &gt; 1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\tau,\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{a_{k+1}} &lt; \\frac{1}{\\tau}, \\quad a_{k+2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{a_{k+1}} &lt; 1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\tau.\\]\n∇ Consider the function \\(f(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\). The sequence from problem 6-17 is the sequence \\(f(1), f(f(1)), ...\\). The behavior of this sequence can be represented graphically in the same way as in the previous problem (Fig. 83).\nFor experts. Experts, of course, noticed that the sequence considered in problem 6-17 can be defined as follows: \\(a_n = \\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}\\), where \\(F_k\\) is the k-th term of the Fibonacci sequence (see the discussion of problem 6-11), i.e., \\(a_n\\) are suitable fractions of the expansion of the number \\(\\tau\\) into an infinite continued fraction (see [63]).\nProblem 6-18. Answer: (0; 2), (2; 0), (\\(-1 + \\sqrt{5}; -1 + \\sqrt{5}\\)), (\\(-1 - \\sqrt{5}; -1 - \\sqrt{5}\\)).\nSubstituting \\(y = (4 - x^2)^2\\) from the first equation into the second, we get a fourth-degree equation\n\\[2 - x^2 = (4 - (2 - x^2)^2)^2,\\]\nwhence \\(x^4 - 4x^2 + 2x = 0\\), or \\(x(x - 2)(x^2 + 2x - 4) = 0\\). Solving this equation, we find the answer.\n∇ Consider a more general system of equations of the form\n\\[y = f(x), \\quad x = f(y)\\]\n(in problem 6-18 \\(f(x)=(4-x^2)^2\\)).\nSubstituting \\(y\\) from the first equation into the second, we reduce the problem to solving the equation \\(x = f(f(x))\\).\nIt is clear that if \\(x\\) is a fixed point of the mapping \\(f\\), i.e., \\(f(x) = x\\), then \\(f(f(x)) = f(x) = x\\). Therefore, among the roots of the equation \\(x = f(f(x))\\) will be all the roots of the equation \\(f(x) = x\\). In problem 6-18, the equation \\(x = f(x)\\) has the form \\(x = (4 - x^2)^2\\) and its roots \\(x = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}\\) give two solutions to the original system.\nIts two other solutions, \\(x = 0\\), \\(x = 2\\), form a “cycle” of period 2.\nFor experts. Consider a more general system:\n\\[x_2^2 = a - x_1^2,\\] \\[x_3^2 = a - x_2^2,\\] \\[...\\] \\[x_p^2 = a - x_{p-1}^2.\\] (*)\nLet’s denote the mapping \\(x \\rightarrow (a - x^2)^2\\) by \\(f\\), and the n-fold iteration of this mapping by \\(f^n\\).\nWe will call the sequence\n\\[x_0, f(x_0), f(f(x_0)), ..., f^n(x_0), ...\\]\nthe orbit of the point \\(x_0\\) under the mapping \\(f\\).\nThe orbit of a point \\(x_0\\) is called periodic (of period \\(p\\)) if \\(f^p(x_0) = x_0\\) and \\(f^k(x_0) \\ne x_0\\) for \\(1 \\le k &lt; p\\).\nOur system (*) reduces to the algebraic equation \\(f^p(x) = x\\) of degree \\(2^p\\). The question of whether this system has a solution \\((x_1, x_2, ..., x_p)\\) with \\(p\\) different numbers (for given values of the parameter \\(a\\)) can be formulated as follows: does the mapping \\(f\\) have an orbit of period \\(p\\)? This question, and in general the study of iterations of continuous functions, has recently been devoted to a number of serious mathematical works.\nFor example, in the family of mappings \\(f_a(x) = (a - x^2)^2\\) (\\(0 \\le a \\le 8\\)), one can trace many interesting phenomena that arise during iterations of mappings of a segment into itself, in particular, the behavior of orbits of different points.\nIt is not difficult to see that for \\(0 \\le a \\le 8\\) our mapping \\(f\\) maps the segment \\(\\left[-1 - \\sqrt{1+a}; -1 + \\sqrt{1+a}\\right]\\) into itself and has two “orbits of period 1” (i.e., two fixed points: \\(x = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+a}\\)). For \\(0 \\le a \\le 3\\), the mapping \\(f\\) has no other periodic orbits. It can be proved that with increasing \\(a\\), orbits with other periods begin to appear: for \\(a &gt; a_1 = 3\\) - with period 2, for \\(a &gt; a_2 = 5\\) - with period 4, for \\(a &gt; a_3 = 5.47...\\) - with period 8, and so on. In general, there is an increasing sequence of numbers \\(a_m\\) such that for \\(a_m &lt; a \\le a_{m+1}\\) the mapping has orbits of each of the periods 1, 2, \\(2^2\\), …, \\(2^m\\) and has no orbits with other periods. This sequence converges to the critical value \\(a_\\infty = 5.6046 ...\\) (found using a computer), after which the nature of typical orbits changes dramatically. In this case, the sequence of differences \\(a_m - a_\\infty\\) behaves approximately like a geometric progression with denominator \\(\\lambda = \\frac{1}{(4.66920...)^{m-1}}\\). (Exactly the same for many other families of continuous mappings, there are sequences of parameter values \\(a_m\\) at which “period doublings” occur, converging to critical values \\(a_\\infty\\), and always the difference \\(a_m - a_\\infty\\) tends to zero as a progression \\(b = c\\lambda^m\\), i.e., the ratio \\((a_m - a_{m-1})/(a_{m+1} - a_m)\\) always tends to the same limit \\(\\lambda\\) - Feigenbaum’s constant.)\nFor \\(a &lt; a_\\infty\\), the behavior of the orbit of almost any point \\(x\\) is relatively simple: if \\(a_m &lt; a \\le a_{m+1}\\), then it approaches some orbit of period \\(2^m\\). In other words, for \\(p = 2^m\\) and \\(a \\le a_{m+1}\\), one solution of our system of equations (*) can be found by the method of successive approximations.\nFor example, for the function \\(f_4(x) = (4 - x^2)^2\\) from problem 6-18, it is easy to verify that the orbit of any point \\(x \\in [-2; 2]\\) approaches the orbit of zero (0; 2; 0; 2; …) of period 2.\nFor \\(a &gt; a_\\infty\\), the picture becomes dramatically more complicated: the orbits of many points \\(x\\) wander chaotically over some infinite subset of the segment. For example, for \\(a = a_\\infty\\), the orbit of zero does not approach any periodic orbit; moreover, even the sequence \\((\\theta_n)\\) of signs of these numbers is non-periodic and has a complex structure (see table).\nIt is interesting to note that this sequence of pluses and minuses \\(\\theta_n\\) is closely related to the Morse sequence from problem 6-13. It turns out that if you write a “+” sign under each pair of adjacent members of the Morse sequence if these members are different, and a “-” sign if they are the same, then you get exactly the sequence \\(\\theta_n\\):\nFor \\(a &gt; a_\\infty\\), the mapping \\(f_a\\) has periodic orbits not only of period \\(2^p\\). The following Sharkovsky’s theorem (see [78]) shows what periods, in principle, the orbits of this mapping can have.\nAll natural numbers are ordered in this way:\nThen, for any two natural numbers, we can say which of them is to the left and which is to the right. If a continuous mapping of a segment into itself has an orbit of period \\(r\\), then it also has orbits of all periods to the right of \\(r\\).\nFor example, the number 3 is to the left of all, and, accordingly, a mapping that has an orbit of period 3 also has orbits of all periods. There are other results on how the properties of iterations of families of continuous mappings of a segment into itself can change depending on the parameter. But many observations obtained using a computer are still waiting for their explanation.\nInterest in this topic is explained by the fact that it is closely related to the study of complex, chaotic (random), i.e. unstable and non-periodic behavior of dynamical systems with three or more variables, modeling a variety of physical processes (see [111, 113]).",

The population of a city consists of n people, and each lives in a separate house. One day, the city residents decided to exchange their houses. After the exchange, it turned out that the distance between the new houses of any two residents is not less than the distance between their old houses. Prove that as a result of the exchange, the distances between the houses of any two city residents did not change.\n6-37. All numbers divisible by nine are written out in order: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, 108, 117, … and for each of these numbers, the sum of its digits is found: 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 18, 9, 9, … (*)\nIt is required to specify the law describing the alternation of numbers in the sequence (*).

Then its middle third - the segment \\([\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}]\\) - is repainted red; then the middle third of each of the remaining green segments is also repainted red, the same operation is performed with the remaining four green segments, and so on to infinity.\n\nFind the sum of the lengths of the red segments.\nProve that the number 1/4 will remain green until the very end.\nFrom the sum \\(\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{2}{27} + \\frac{2}{81} + ...\\), an infinite number of terms are arbitrarily crossed out so that an infinite number of terms also remain; prove that their sum is a green number.\nProve that all other numbers (between 0 and 1) are red.\n\n6-39. Let’s call the Dragon curve an infinite sequence of segments \\(A_0A_1\\), \\(A_1A_2\\), \\(A_2A_3\\), … (on a plane), which is constructed according to the following rule. First, points \\(A_0\\) and \\(A_1\\) are chosen, different from each other. Then, step by step, the following points are constructed. At the k-th step, where k = 1, 2, …, the already constructed broken line \\(A_0A_1...A_{2^{k-1}}\\) is rotated around its last point \\(A_{2^{k-1}}\\) clockwise by 90°. During this rotation, \\(A_0\\) moves to \\(A_{2^k}\\), \\(A_1\\) moves to \\(A_{2^k-1}\\), in general \\(A_m\\) moves to \\(A_{2^k-m}\\) for all \\(m \\in {0,1,...,2^{k-1}-1}\\). This produces the broken line \\(A_0A_1...A_{2^k}\\), and then the next step is made (Fig.84).\n\n\n\nFig.84\n\n\n\nConstruct the broken line \\(A_0A_1...A_{32}\\).\nFind the general formula for the sequence of distances \\(A_0A_1\\), \\(A_0A_2\\), \\(A_0A_4\\), …, \\(A_0A_{2^k}\\), …\nProve that the Dragon curve does not pass twice along any segment.\nIt is convenient to draw the Dragon curve on graph paper (each link is a side of a cell). Prove that four infinite Dragon curves starting from one node of the graph paper in four different directions pass through all segments of an infinite sheet of graph paper.\n\n6-40. Gnomes living in white and red houses paint their houses simultaneously every year, and only those gnomes change the color of their house who have more than half of their friends living in houses of a different color in the past year.

    "text": "6.3 Hints for Independent Practice Problems\n2-23. You need to determine if the equation \\(13x + 16y = 300\\) has a solution in non-negative integers (see 2-1, 2-6, p. 17, 21).\n2-24. The ratio of the lengths of the circumferences is \\(40/18 = 20/9\\). Therefore, the nail will leave marks every \\(9/20\\) of the length of the larger circumference (see 2-8, p. 22).\n2-25. See 2-7, 2-8, p. 21–23.\n2-26. Since gcd(360, 48) = 24, question a) reduces to this: does there exist a figure that, when rotated around point O by 24°, transforms into itself, but not when rotated by 90°?\n2-27. See 2-7, p. 21.\n2-28. You can perform a “descent” similar to the Euclidean algorithm (see 2-4, p. 18), using the following statements: gcd(a − b, b) = gcd(a, b); gcd(a + b, b) = gcd(a, b); if the numbers a and b are odd, then gcd(2k ⋅a,b) = gcd(a,b). ∇ Discarding the excess power of two is the main idea of the “binary algorithm” for finding the greatest common divisor, which for numbers in binary notation (used in computers) is more convenient than the Euclidean algorithm (see [94], vol. 2, 4-5-2).\n2-29. See 2-4, p. 18.\n2-30. Find the sum of all numbers in the rectangle in two ways: “by rows” and “by columns”.\n2-31. b) See 2-9, 2-10, p. 23–24.\n2-33. In the equation \\(pq − p − q + 1 = 6\\), the left side can be factored.\n2-34. b) See 2-10, p. 24.\n2-35. b) The number \\(n^3 - 1\\) is divisible by \\(n - 1\\).\n2-36. a) The polynomial \\(x^2 − (y + 1)^2\\) can be factored; after that, you need to consider all possible factorizations of the number 12 into a product of two integers of the same parity.\n2-38. See 2-10, 2-16, p. 24, 28.\n2-39. If \\(m\\) is not divisible by 5, then \\(m^2 - n^2\\) is divisible by 5; this can be proved by finding out what remainders the squares (and fourth powers) give when divided by 5.\n2-40. Factorize \\(a^k - 1\\) using the formula from the solution of problem 2-17 b), p. 29, and use the fact that the remainder when dividing \\(a\\) by \\(k\\) is 1.\n2-41. The last three digits of any natural number greater than 100 are the same as the 100th power of the number formed by its last three digits (and even the 100th power of its last digit).\n2-42. See 2-13, p. 26.\n2-43. See 2-14, p. 27.\n2-44. See 2-15, p. 28.\n2-45. a) \\(n^4 + 4 = (n^2 + 2)^2 - (2n)^2\\). b) See 2-18, p. 30.\n2-47. It is sufficient to prove that this polynomial is divisible by each of the polynomials \\(x\\), \\(x + 1\\), \\(2x + 1\\) (by Bezout’s theorem, see the comment to 2-17 b), p. 30).\n2-48. You can find out for which \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) this polynomial is divisible by \\(x - 1\\) (see 2-17, p. 29–30), and factor out the factor \\(x - 1\\). ∇ The polynomial \\(p(x)\\) is divisible by \\((x - d)\\) if and only if it itself and its derivative \\(p'(x)\\) are divisible by \\(x - d\\).\n2-49. Dividing the polynomial \\(f(x)\\) by \\((x - 1)(x - 2)\\) with a remainder means representing it in the form \\(f(x) = g(x)(x - 1)(x - 2) + ax + b\\). You can find the numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) further by Bezout’s theorem (see 2-17 b), p. 29).\n2-50. For any polynomial \\(f(x)\\) with integer coefficients, the number \\(f(k)\\) for even \\(k\\) has the same parity as \\(f(0)\\), and for odd \\(k\\) – the same as \\(f(1)\\).\n2-51. If a polynomial with integer coefficients has an integer root \\(c\\), then its value at an integer point \\(d\\) (with \\(c \\ne d\\)) is divisible by \\(d - c\\) (see 2-17 b), p. 29).\n2-52. One of the factors must be a polynomial of the third (or lower) degree. Such a polynomial cannot take the value 1 at four or more points (this follows from Bezout’s theorem). Prove that a polynomial of the third degree cannot take the value 1 at three integer points and the value -1 at two points.\n2-53. a) Reasoning in the same way as in problem 2-40, you can make sure that the number of cards of each type. Let \\(x_k\\) denote the product of the first \\(k\\) numbers. It is represented as \\(x_k = y^2 S_k\\), where \\(y\\) is a natural number, and \\(S_k = (\\alpha_k, \\beta_k, \\gamma_k, \\delta_k)\\) is a set of 0s and 1s. The sets \\(S_m\\) and \\(S_{m+1}\\) differ only in one of the four places. For the condition of the problem to be satisfied, it is necessary that none of these sets consists of only zeros and no two sets \\(S_m\\) and \\(S_n\\) coincide when \\(m \\ne n\\). Indeed, if some set \\(S_k\\) consists of only zeros, then the product of the first \\(k\\) numbers is a perfect square, and if some two sets \\(S_m\\) and \\(S_n\\), where \\(m &gt; n\\), coincide, then the product of numbers from the \\((n+1)\\)-th to the \\(m\\)-th is a perfect square.\n\nThe problem reduces to this: is it possible to write out 15 non-zero sets of four digits 0 and 1 one after another so that any two adjacent ones differ in exactly one place, and the first one is a set of three zeros and one one?\nCalculate the total number of sets \\(S_k\\) (see [7], problem 3-17).\nFor “experts”, this problem can be reformulated as follows: what is the largest number of edges of an \\(n\\)-dimensional cube that a chain of edges can contain without passing through the same vertex twice?\n\n2-54. If the sets \\(S_m\\) and \\(S_n\\), where \\(m &gt; n\\), coincide, then the product of numbers from the \\((n+1)\\)-th to the \\(m\\)-th is a perfect square. a) The problem reduces to this: is it possible to write out 15 non-zero sets of four digits 0 and 1 one after another so that any two adjacent ones differ in exactly one place, and the first one is a set of three zeros and one one? b) Calculate the total number of sets \\(S_m\\) (see [7], problem 3-17). c) For “experts”, this problem can be reformulated as follows: what is the largest number of edges of an \\(n\\)-dimensional cube that a chain of edges can contain without passing through the same vertex twice?\n2-55. If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are coprime, then on each line \\(ax + by = c\\), where \\(c\\) is an integer, a tree grows (see 2-2, 2-6, 2-7, p. 17, 20, 21).\n2-56. See 2-21, p. 32.\n2-57. In the proof, you can use the formula for the Euler totient function, given in the comment to the solution of 2-8, p. 22.\n2-58. b) The proof is conveniently carried out by induction, starting with the last digit 5 or 6. ∇ The entire infinite leftward sequence of such digits (for example, \\(x = ...376\\)) forms a so-called 10-adic number, for which \\(x^2 = x\\); thus, in 10-adic numbers, the quadratic equation \\(x^2 = x\\) has, besides the solutions \\(x = 0 = ...000\\) and \\(x = 1 = ...001\\), two more solutions. In the theory of \\(p\\)-adic numbers, the properties of integers and real numbers are intertwined in a curious way (see [82]).\n2-59. Let the triple of numbers \\((x_0, y_0, z_0)\\) be a solution to the given equation. Then all triples obtained from it by permutations of the numbers \\(x_0\\), \\(y_0\\), \\(z_0\\) are also solutions. If we substitute the triple \\((x_0, y_0, z_0)\\) into the equation, then from the resulting quadratic equation in \\(x\\), a new solution to the original equation is found.\n2-60. Consider simultaneously the number \\((3 + 2)^{1987} = a^3 + b^2\\).\n2-61. It is useful to associate the expression \\(a + ab + b^2\\) from \\(M\\) with the expression \\(a + b\\omega\\) and, when multiplying two such expressions, consider \\(\\omega^2\\) equal to \\(\\omega - 1\\) (then, in particular, the equality \\((a + b\\omega)(a - b\\omega^2) = a^2 + ab + b^2\\) will hold). Here, \\(\\omega\\) denotes the complex number \\(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\), and \\(-\\omega^2 = 1 - \\omega = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{-3}}{2}\\) is the conjugate to this number.\n2-62. You can take \\(y = x! - 1\\).\n3-26. 1) See the solution and comment to 3-7, p. 49–50, Fig. 19. 3) If \\(t = ab/c\\), then \\(c/a = b/n\\). 4) Let \\(m = a^2 = a + a\\), \\(n = a^3 = m + a\\), then \\(a^2(2 + 3) = a m(m + n)\\). 6) Let \\(m = 2a\\), then \\(a^2 = m \\cdot a\\).\n3-27. Regarding such constructions, see 3-2, p. 44–46. In part 1), \\(b^2 - a^2 = (b - a)(b + a)\\), in part 2) \\(a^3 = 3a \\cdot a\\), in part 3) \\(a^2 = 2a \\cdot a\\), so in these parts, the constructions reduce to the construction of the geometric mean \\(\\sqrt{ab}\\) of segments \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) – see p. 49, Fig. 19. To do this, repeat Fig. 19, draw the radius \\(OK\\) on it and the segment symmetric to it with respect to the line \\(KB\\). 4) Here, you can use the segment \\(a^2\\) already constructed in part 3).\n3-28. See 3-3, p. 46.\n3-29. Here, it is convenient to use the method of geometric loci – see 3-4, p. 46. The geometric locus of the midpoints of segments, one end of which is at a given point, and the other is on a given circle, is a circle.\n3-30–3-31. Here, it is convenient to act using the similarity method – see 3-6, p. 48–49.\n3-32. The vertex of the rectangle farthest from the origin is on the line \\(y = \\frac{\\pi}{3} - 2x\\).\n3-33. \\(r_{\\pi} = r_{\\pi} \\cdot 11\\).\n3-34. Use the identity \\(\\cos \\phi = 4 \\cos^3 \\frac{\\phi}{3} - 3 \\cos \\frac{\\phi}{3}\\). Let \\(\\cos \\frac{\\phi}{3} = x\\), then \\(4x^3 = \\cos \\phi + 3x\\).\n3-35–3-36. It is convenient to reflect the figures themselves from the walls: angle and billiards – see 3-16, p. 58. In 3-36, consider first a billiard with dimensions 3 × 5 and make a drawing.\n3-37. Circumscribe a circle around triangle \\(ABC\\).\n3-38. See 3-8, p. 50.\n3-39. Use 3-14 (p. 55) and the fact that \\(\\sqrt{16 - \\sqrt{110}} = \\sqrt{115}\\).\n3-40. An ellipse is the geometric locus of points in a plane, the sum of the distances from which to two given points of this plane is constant. A hyperbola is the geometric locus of points in a plane, the absolute value of the difference of the distances from which to two given points of this plane is constant.\n3-41. b) Prove that if the segments lie on different lines, then any axis of symmetry of the union of the segments is the axis of symmetry of one of the segments.\n3-42. Here, it is convenient to act using the similarity method – see 3-6, p. 48.\n3-43, 3-44. See 3-10, p. 51–53.\n3-46. Prove that the three common chords of three pairwise intersecting circles intersect at one point, and use the previous problem 3-45.\n3-47. Among the vertices of a regular dodecagon, you can choose four vertices in different ways, all pairwise distances between which are different.\n3-48. The proof is conveniently carried out using the method of mathematical induction (see [112]) by the number of lines.\n3-50. See 3-19, p. 62. The geometric locus of the centers of spheres tangent to two intersecting planes is a pair of perpendicular planes. The geometric locus of the centers of spheres tangent to three pairwise intersecting planes is the intersection of two pairs of planes, i.e., four lines. The number of points equidistant from four pairwise intersecting planes is no more than eight.\n3-51. Not all parts are tetrahedra, some of them are octahedra (Fig. 68 on p. 116).\n3-52. See 3-19, p. 62.\n3-53. a) The plane passing through the midpoint of the diagonal of the cube and perpendicular to it is the geometric locus of points equidistant from its ends. Find such points on the edges of the cube. b) Divide the diagonal into three equal parts and find the formula for \\(S(x)\\) in each of these parts. The area of the projection of the cross-section onto the face of the cube is equal to \\(S(x) \\cdot \\sin \\phi\\), where \\(\\phi\\) is the angle between the diagonal and the face of the cube.\n3-54. Prove that the trihedral angles of a tetrahedron are equal (see 3-24, 3-25, p. 66–68).\n3-55. First draw a planar diagram of such a polyhedron (see 3-23, p. 66).\n3-56. Prove that: a) the area of a “slice” – a spherical digon cut out on a sphere by a dihedral angle of a trihedral angle, is equal to \\(2\\alpha\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is the magnitude of the dihedral angle; b) a spherical triangle is the intersection of three digons formed by the three dihedral angles of a trihedral angle.\n4-25. The maximum value is achieved when \\(a = b\\). You can express all the necessary elements of the triangle, for example, through the magnitude of an acute angle.\n4-26. Use the fact that \\(f(0) = f(1) = 1\\), and the minimum value \\(f\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) of the function \\(f(x)\\) is not less than -1.\n4-27. See 4-5, p. 77.\n4-28. The sum of the three smallest numbers is no greater than three times the arithmetic mean of all 10 numbers.\n4-30. See 4-3, p. 75. Start by calculating all the areas for several characteristic cases: a point at a vertex, in the middle of a side, at the intersection point of the medians.\n4-31. First, it is useful to find what minimum value the product of the diagonals can have.\n4-32. How much, the smallest and the largest, does one pen cost?\n4-33. You can act in the same way as in 4-6 b), p. 78–79, using the equality \\(\\sqrt{1}(\\sqrt{3} - 1) = (\\sqrt{3} + 1)^2\\). ∇ The expansion of \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) into a continued fraction is periodic. The fact that 220 volts and 127 volts are the usual voltage in the network is not accidental – see [57].\n4-34. See 4-8, p. 80.\n4-35. See 4-9, p. 82. Let \\(p\\) be the distance a person manages to walk from one overtake to the next. Then \\(5p \\le 4 &lt; 7p\\), \\(7p \\le 7 &lt; 9p\\), \\((x - 1)p \\le 17 &lt; (x + 1)p\\), where \\(x\\) is the desired number of buses.\n4-37. Let \\(S\\) be the sum of all eleven numbers. Then each of them is the root of the equation \\(x^2 = (S - x)^2\\), which has no more than two solutions. Therefore, among the desired numbers, there are no more than two different ones.\n4-38. Find the ratio of the value of the given quantity for \\(n = k + 1\\) to the value for \\(n = k\\) and find out for which \\(k\\) this ratio is greater than 1, and for which it is less (see 4-13, p. 85).\n4-39. It is useful to consider first the case when all the numbers are equal to each other. To obtain an upper bound for \\(n\\), it is convenient to add the inequalities \\(a_{ij}^2 + a_{ik}^2 \\ge 2a_{ij}a_{ik}\\), where \\(a_k\\) (1 ≤ k ≤ n) are the numbers referred to in the condition of the problem.\n4-40. See 4-15, p. 86.\n4-41. The integrals on the left side can be represented as the areas of curvilinear triangles located below and above the graph of the function \\(y = \\sin x\\) (see 4-16, p. 87).\n4-42. Here, it is convenient to use the same technique as in the proof of each inequality in 4-15, p. 86; in one of the cases, you also need to take into account the triangle inequality.\n4-43. a) Represent the given numbers as powers with the same exponents and compare the bases of these powers. b) To compare the numbers \\(2^{34}\\) and \\(3^{98}\\) with \\(2^{148}\\) (i.e., \\(\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^9\\) with \\(2^2\\) – see 4-4, p. 75–77). c) Compare the numbers \\(\\log_5(6^5)\\), \\(\\log_6(6^5)\\), \\(\\log_7(7^6)\\). d) You can use the equality \\(2 \\sin 7^\\circ \\cdot \\sin 5^\\circ = \\cos 2^\\circ - \\cos 12^\\circ\\). Other solutions to parts c), d), and e) can be obtained using the following fact: if the function \\(\\lg f(x)\\) is convex upwards (see 4-18, p. 89), then \\(\\frac{f(x+1)}{f(x)} \\ge \\frac{f(x)}{f(x-1)}\\).\n4-44. You can reason in the same way as in the solution of problem 4-18, p. 89, using the functions: a) \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + x}\\); b) \\(f(x) = \\lg \\sin x\\).\n4-45. It is advantageous to include only twos and threes in the desired sum.\n4-46. See 4-19, p. 91.\n4-47. Estimate the number of nodes of an infinite grid of equilateral triangles with side 1 lying in a circle of radius 10 centered at one of the nodes of the grid (it is sufficient to count the number of nodes lying in a regular hexagon with sides of length 10, going along the lines of the grid).\n4-48. See 4-23, p. 93.\n4-49. Reflecting the hypotenuse symmetrically with respect to the legs, we obtain on its images – two parallel segments – new points \\(K'\\) and \\(H'\\) – the images of points \\(K\\) and \\(H\\). The problem reduces to minimizing the length of the broken line \\(K'PQH'\\). (There are infinitely many positions of points \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) for which the minimum length is achieved.)\n4-50. The square of the distance between two points moving uniformly and rectilinearly is expressed by a quadratic trinomial of time (it is easier to prove this by switching to a coordinate system associated with one of these points). From three values of the quadratic trinomial, you can calculate its coefficients, and then find its minimum.\n5-22. b) Negative numbers make sense to write in five cells – the central one and the four that have a common vertex with it – and positive ones in the remaining 20 cells.\n5-23. The snail could have crawled from 4 to 12 meters (see 5-1, p. 100).\n5-24. See 5-3, p. 103.\n5-25. See 5-5, p. 104–105.\n5-26. a) It is useful to consider first the situation when 2, 3, and 4 people are riding in the bus. b) After the exchange, everyone must have at least one coin left. c) It is useful to find out how many of the 15 people have only one 15-kopeck coin.\n5-27. It is convenient to make a table where the rows correspond to colors, and the columns correspond to styles.\n5-28. See 5-6, p. 105.\n5-29. a) Construct a triangle using a compass and a ruler from two sides and an angle opposite one of them. Investigate how many solutions this construction problem has. b) Consider two triangles: one with sides 1, \\(a\\), \\(\\sqrt{a}\\), the second with sides \\(a\\), \\(\\sqrt{a}\\), \\(\\sqrt{a}\\). For which \\(a\\) do these triangles exist?\n5-30. Prove that one of the angles between the angle bisectors of a triangle is not less than \\(60^\\circ\\) (express the angles between the angle bisectors through the angles of the triangle for this). Estimate the area of the quadrilateral whose diagonals are these angle bisectors. See [36], problem 272.\n5-32. This problem is related to the equality \\(4 + 4 \\cdot 2^3 + 4 \\cdot 3^3 + ... + 4 \\cdot k^3 = k^2(k+1)^2\\).\n5-33. d) Try to first cut a right triangle into two isosceles ones.\n5-35. a) An internal quadrilateral is not necessarily convex. b) The length of any segment located inside a quadrilateral does not exceed half of its perimeter.\n5-36. b) Consider the cases of even and odd \\(n\\) (see 5-16, p. 116).\n5-37. a) Consider a wire icosahedron, see 5-15 b), p. 116. b) Try to count the number of segments (see 5-16 b), 5-17 b), p. 117).\n5-38. It is convenient to represent each of the numbers from 1 to 81 as a sum of powers of three, i.e., write it in the ternary number system.\n5-40. If \\(7^8 = q^k\\), \\(9^8 = q^n\\) for some integers \\(k\\) and \\(n\\), then \\(7 \\cdot 9 = 8^{n+k}\\).\n5-41. 6) If each switch has two states (on-off), then three switches have a total of eight different states, one of which corresponds to the case when all the bulbs are off.\n5-42. Let’s depict the problems with black circles, the participants with white ones, and from each participant, let’s draw segments to those problems that he solved. Then all the segments form one or several closed paths – cycles. d) In each cycle, the choice is made in two ways, and there are no more than 10 cycles.\n5-43. It is more convenient to describe the periodic arrangement of officers on an infinite checkered plane \\(Oху\\), divided into 5 × 5 squares, in each of which the arrangement with the necessary properties is repeated. Officers of each rank can be arranged along parallel inclined lines of the same direction, say, with a slope of 1, and each type of troops in a different direction, say, with a slope of 2. ∇ The required arrangement can also be obtained using a finite field of remainders from division by 5 – see the comment to 5-20, p. 121.\n5-44. a) Let’s take a segment, place three vertices of the outer pyramid very close to one of its ends, and the fourth to the other. Let’s place two vertices of the inner pyramid near one end of the segment, and the other two near the other. b) This problem is a generalization of the following theorem: the perimeter of a convex polygon is less than the perimeter of any polygon containing it.\n5-47. The stations can be placed at the vertices of a cube.\n5-48. In such a polyhedron, all edges of the same direction have the same length, and for each pair of directions, there are exactly two faces with the corresponding directions of the sides.\n5-49. 6) The polynomial in part a) can be written as \\(C_n + C_n^* + y + 1\\) (see the comment to 2-16, p. 28).\n5-50. Find the range of the polynomial \\((1 - xy) + x^2\\).\n6-19. See 6-16), p. 134.\n6-20. c) Prove that if in the decimal expansion of the fraction \\(p/r\\), \\(0 &lt; p &lt; r\\), two identical digits \\(a\\) appear somewhere, then there exists a natural number \\(m\\) such that \\(m/r = 0.aa...\\), i.e., the inequalities \\(\\frac{m}{r} - \\frac{a}{10} &lt; \\frac{1}{100}\\), \\(0 &lt; \\frac{a}{10} &lt; \\frac{m}{r} + \\frac{1}{100}\\) hold. The problem reduces to this: you need to choose primes \\(r\\) such that for no natural \\(a &lt; 9\\) the two-digit number formed by the last two digits of the number \\(11a\\) does not exceed the number \\(100/r\\). It remains to investigate the cases where \\(a &lt; 162\\).\n6-21. Find the period.\n6-22. Prove that if \\(a_n &gt; 163\\), then \\(a_{n+1} &lt; a_n\\). Investigate the cases where \\(a_n &lt; 162\\).\n6-23. See 6-3, p. 135.\n6-24. See 6-2, p. 134–135.\n6-25. See 6-5, p. 136.\n6-26. See p. 149–151. After drawing the graphs of the functions \\(y = -x^2\\) and \\(y = x\\), you need to study the behavior of the sequence \\((x_n)\\), defined by the relation \\(x_{n+1} = 1 - x_n^2\\) for different \\(x_1\\). The answer in the problem depends on the parity of \\(n\\).\n6-27. a) The function \\(f(x) = x(-x)\\) increases for \\(0 &lt; x &lt; 1/2\\); \\(f(x) &lt; 1/4\\) for \\(0 &lt; x &lt; 1\\), and from \\(f(\\sqrt{x}) &lt; \\sqrt{x + 1}\\), it can be shown that \\(x_n &lt; \\frac{1}{n + 2}\\) for \\(n &gt; 1\\). b) It is convenient to make the substitution \\(x_n = -\\frac{1}{n} + h_n\\).\n6-28. It can be proved by mathematical induction that \\(P_n(x)\\) has \\(n\\) roots. Considering the alternation of the signs of the polynomial \\(P_{n+1}(x)\\) at the points where \\(P_n(x)\\) is zero, it can be proved that between any two roots of \\(P_n(x)\\) there is a root of \\(P_{n+1}(x)\\); in addition, by determining the sign of \\(P_n(x)\\) and \\(P_{n+1}(x)\\) for large absolute values of \\(x\\), it can be proved that \\(P_{n+1}(x)\\) has a root to the right of the largest of the roots of \\(P_n(x)\\) and to the left of its smallest root.\n6-29. a) The ant’s path consists of segments whose lengths form two infinitely decreasing geometric progressions.\n6-30. Triangles taken every other one will be similar to each other.\n6-31. Use the inequality \\(\\sin x &lt; x\\) for \\(x &gt; 0\\).\n6-32. b), c) You can prove the inequality \\(a_n &gt; 3n\\) and estimate the difference \\(a_n - 3n\\).\n6-33. Both statements can be proved by mathematical induction (see 6-16, p. 149): if the inequalities \\(0 &lt; 2 - a_n &lt; \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^n\\) are true for \\(n = k\\), then they are also true for \\(n = k + 1\\).\n6-34. You can indicate a \\(q &lt; 1\\) such that (starting from some \\(n\\)) \\(|a_{n+1} - 2| &lt; q |a_n - 2|\\).\n6-35. b) Consider a triple of numbers of the form \\(kx^2\\), \\(kx\\), \\(k\\).\n6-36. Consider the sum of all pairwise distances; it, of course, does not change during relocations.\n6-38. It is convenient to consider numbers between 0 and 1 as infinite ternary fractions consisting of the digits 0, 1, 2; the numbers referred to in part c) are those in whose ternary representation there are infinitely many zeros and twos and no ones.\n6-39. c) For the proof, it is more convenient to use a different method of constructing the Dragon curve than the one indicated in the condition (of course, you need to prove that it leads to the same curve): at the \\(n\\)-th step, on each segment of the already constructed curve, as on the hypotenuse, an isosceles right-angled triangle is constructed, alternately on the right and on the left (so that the adjacent triangles are obtained from each other by a rotation of \\(90^\\circ\\) around the common vertex); the legs of the constructed triangles form a new curve; rotating it by \\(45^\\circ\\) relative to the initial point and increasing it similarly by \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) times, you can proceed to the \\((n + 1)\\)-th step. (A detailed story about Dragon curves can be found in “Kvant” No. 2, 1970.) d) The known proof uses Gaussian (integer complex) numbers; it would be interesting to find a simple elementary solution.\n6-40. Let’s draw the houses of all the gnomes on one sheet of paper in two copies. On the first copy, we will paint the houses (according to the rules specified in the problem) in odd years (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), and on the second in even years. Let’s connect each house with the houses of the friends of the gnome who lives in it, on the other copy. For the resulting scheme (it is called a bipartite graph), you can use the same technique as in the solution of 6-7, p. 137.",

Let their masses be \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), and \\(a &lt; b\\). Take two more weights and compare them: \\(c &lt; d\\). Then compare the heavier weights of these pairs; we can assume that \\(b &lt; d\\).\nFind the place of the fifth weight with mass \\(e\\) among the three \\(a &lt; b &lt; d\\). Two weighings are enough for this: first, you need to compare \\(e\\) with \\(b\\), then you need to compare \\(e\\) with \\(a\\) if \\(e &lt; b\\), and with \\(d\\) if \\(e &gt; b\\). Now we know how the four weights \\(a, b, d\\), and \\(e\\) are ordered.\nFind the place of the weight with mass \\(c\\) among the three weights \\(a, b, e\\); this will also take two weighings. Since after stage 1 we know that \\(c &lt; d\\), thus we will find the place of \\(c\\) among the four remaining weights.",
