<p>Here’s the discussion translated into English:</p>
<section id="problems-discussion" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problems-discussion"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Problems Discussion</h2>
<p><strong>Problem 4-1.</strong> By two methods of calculating the area of a triangle, we get <span class="math inline">\(ch = ab\)</span>, hence <span class="math inline">\(h = \frac{ab}{c}\)</span>. The inequality <span class="math inline">\(c + h &gt; a + b\)</span> can be written as: [ + c &gt; a + b. ] Multiplying both sides by <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(c &gt; 0\)</span>), we obtain the equivalent inequality: [ c^2 - c(a+b) + ab &gt; 0, ] or [ (c - a)(c - b) &gt; 0. ] This inequality is true because the hypotenuse is greater than each leg.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> In solving this problem, we established that if the products <span class="math inline">\(ch\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ab\)</span> of two pairs of positive numbers are equal, then the sum is greater for the pair whose numbers are more “spread out”: if <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are between <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(c + h &gt; a + b\)</span>. This fact also follows from the fact that the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x + \frac{A}{x}\)</span> is monotonically increasing for <span class="math inline">\(x \geq A\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-2.</strong> Answer: <span class="math inline">\(c &lt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\)</span>. By condition, it does not cross zero, so its graph - a parabola - is either entirely above or entirely below the x-axis.</p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline">\(f(1) = a + b + c\)</span>; this number, by condition, is less than zero, which means the parabola is below the x-axis. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &lt; 0\)</span> for all values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and, in particular, <span class="math inline">\(f(0) = c &lt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>∇ In the solution, we essentially used the continuity of the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: if a function is continuous on an interval and does not become zero on it, then all its values on this interval have the same sign.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-3.</strong> Let’s draw the axes of symmetry of the rectangle. They divide the given rectangle into 4 quarters. If the selected point lies in any of the two quarters containing points A and C, or on the boundary of these quarters, then the statement of the problem is obvious. Let the selected point lie inside one of the two remaining quarters. Reflect both cut lines with respect to the center of symmetry of the rectangle. Four lines (two cut lines and two symmetrical to them) divide the rectangle into 9 parts: four parts with area <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span>, two parts with area <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span>, two parts with area <span class="math inline">\(S_3\)</span>, and one part with area <span class="math inline">\(S_0\)</span> (Fig. 46). We must prove that <span class="math inline">\(S_1 + S_2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(S_1 + S_3\)</span> does not exceed <span class="math inline">\(\frac{S}{4}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the area of the entire rectangle.</p>

<p>Since <span class="math display">\[4S_1 + 2S_2 + 2S_3 = S - S_0 &lt; S,\]</span> then <span class="math display">\[2S_1 + S_2 + S_3 &lt; \frac{S}{2}, \text{ or } (S_1 + S_2) + (S_1 + S_3) &lt; \frac{S}{2}.\]</span> This means that one of the numbers <span class="math inline">\(S_1 + S_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S_1 + S_3\)</span> is less than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{S}{4}\)</span> (if both were not less than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{S}{4}\)</span>, then their sum would be not less than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{S}{2}\)</span>).</p>
<p>∇ The following stereometric problem, similar to problem 4-3, is of interest: let <span class="math inline">\(V_1 \leq V_2 \leq \dots \leq V_8\)</span> be the volumes of the eight parts into which a parallelepiped of volume 1 is divided by three planes passing through its point and parallel to its faces; within what limits can each of the values <span class="math inline">\(V_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i = 1, 2, \dots, 8\)</span> vary? For example, it turns out that <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq V_4 \leq \frac{1}{8}\)</span> and for any <span class="math inline">\(V_4\)</span> from this interval, there is a corresponding partition of the parallelepiped. (When proving the inequality <span class="math inline">\(V_4 \leq \frac{1}{8}\)</span>, it is convenient to use the fact that two opposite parts have volumes whose products are not greater than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{64}\)</span>.) A similar question can be considered for an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional parallelepiped of unit volume.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-4.</strong> Answer: if the bank accrues interest once a month. Let the interest be accrued once a year. Then at the end of the first year, the deposit will be equal to <span class="math display">\[\left(1000 + 1000 \cdot \frac{5}{100} \right) = 1000 \left(1 + \frac{5}{100} \right) \text{ rubles}.\]</span> At the end of the second year, the deposit will increase by 5% from this amount and will become equal to <span class="math display">\[1000 \left(1 + \frac{5}{100} \right) \left(1 + \frac{5}{100} \right) = 1000 \left(1 + \frac{5}{100} \right)^2 \text{ rubles}.\]</span> Reasoning similarly, we see that after 10 years the depositor will receive <span class="math display">\[1000 \left(1 + \frac{5}{100} \right)^{10} \text{ rubles}.\]</span> If interest is accrued once a month, then in the same way we find that the depositor will receive after 10 years (i.e., after 120 months) <span class="math display">\[1000 \left(1 + \frac{5}{1200} \right)^{120} \text{ rubles}.\]</span> We will show that the second number is greater than the first. To do this, it is enough to show that <span class="math display">\[\left(1 + \frac{5}{100} \right) &lt; \left(1 + \frac{5}{1200} \right)^{12}.\]</span> Let’s start calculating the right side of this inequality – the product of twelve identical expressions <span class="math display">\[\left(1 + \frac{5}{1200} \right) \left(1 + \frac{5}{1200} \right) \dots \left(1 + \frac{5}{1200} \right).\]</span> In the process of multiplication, we will have to take 1 in each bracket and multiply them all – we get 1 as a result. If we take <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{1200}\)</span> in one bracket and 1 in the others, then we get <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{1200}\)</span>; but there are as many such products as there are brackets, i.e.&nbsp;12, and they give the number <span class="math inline">\(12 \cdot \frac{5}{1200} = \frac{5}{100}\)</span>. Although we have not taken into account all the terms, we already got <span class="math inline">\(1 + \frac{5}{100}\)</span>, so the entire product will be greater than this number.</p>
<p>∇ Let K rubles be deposited in the bank and the bank pays p% per annum. Reasoning in the same way as in the solution to problem 4-4, we will see that after m years the depositor will receive <span class="math inline">\(K \left(1 + \frac{p}{100} \right)^m\)</span> rubles (the so-called compound interest formula). This value can be roughly estimated from below using Bernoulli’s inequality, which we have essentially already proved: <span class="math display">\[\left(1 + x \right)^n &gt; 1 + nx \text{ for } x &gt; 0, n &gt; 1.\]</span> (In the solution to problem 4-4, it was <span class="math inline">\(x = \frac{5}{1200}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n = 12\)</span>.) It follows from this inequality that if we reduce the payment periods and proportionally reduce the interest rate, then the depositor will receive a larger amount. This is due to the fact that for <span class="math inline">\(a &gt; 0\)</span> the sequence <span class="math display">\[x = \left(1 + \frac{a}{n} \right)^n\]</span> is increasing. However, it turns out that the depositor will not be able to get too much benefit from reducing the terms, since this sequence is bounded. Its limit is the number <span class="math inline">\(e^a\)</span>. If you calculate the sums from problem 4-4 on a calculator, then in the first case we get about 1629 rubles, in the second – about 1647 rubles, and <span class="math inline">\(1000e^{0.05} \approx 1649\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let there be <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> overcrowded and <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> non-overcrowded buses in the column. Denote the number of passengers traveling in overcrowded buses by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and the number of the rest by <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(A &gt; 50k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B \leq 50l\)</span>, and therefore <span class="math inline">\(\frac{A}{k} &gt; 50\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{B}{l} \leq 50\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{A}{k} &gt; \frac{B}{l}\)</span>. From the last inequality, the following follows: <span class="math display">\[\frac{B}{A} &lt; \frac{l}{k},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{A + B}{A} &lt; \frac{l + k}{k},\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\frac{A}{A + B} &gt; \frac{k}{l + k},\]</span> from where <span class="math display">\[\frac{A}{A + B} \cdot 100\% &gt; \frac{k}{l + k} \cdot 100\%.\]</span> In the last inequality, on the left is the percentage of people traveling in overcrowded buses, and on the right is the percentage of overcrowded buses.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-6.</strong> Answer: a) 7; b) 16. Let there be <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> participants in the circle, of which <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are girls. We need to find the smallest natural number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for which there exists such a natural number <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> that <span class="math display">\[\frac{2}{5} &lt; \frac{m}{n} &lt; \frac{1}{2}.\]</span> Iterating through the values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> from 2 to 7, we find that only the fraction <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{7}\)</span> with denominator 7 satisfies this inequality. Thus, 7 is the smallest possible value of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>∇ Note that the fraction <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{7}\)</span> is obtained from the fractions <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{5}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> as follows: its numerator is the sum of their numerators, and the denominator is the sum of their denominators.</p>
<p>For any positive fractions <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{c}{d}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b} &lt; \frac{c}{d}\)</span>), the fraction <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a+c}{b+d}\)</span> satisfies the inequalities <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b} &lt; \frac{a+c}{b+d} &lt; \frac{c}{d}\)</span> and is called the mediant of these fractions.</p>
<p>Writing out irreducible fractions with a denominator not exceeding <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> in ascending order, we get the following table: <img src="illustrations/p78.png" class="img-fluid"> Each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th row (Farey sequence) is obtained from the <span class="math inline">\((n-1)\)</span>-th row according to the following rule: in the <span class="math inline">\((n-1)\)</span>-th row, one needs to mark all such pairs of neighboring fractions <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{c}{d}\)</span>, for which the sum of the denominators is equal to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and insert their mediants – fractions <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a+c}{b+d}\)</span> (they are always irreducible) between them.</p>
<p>In problem a), we found the row number <span class="math inline">\(n=7\)</span>, in which the fraction located between the fractions <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{5}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> first appears.</p>
<p>In problem b), acting by brute force is quite tedious. Let’s proceed as follows. We must find a solution to the inequalities <span class="math display">\[
\frac{43}{100} &lt; \frac{m}{n} &lt; \frac{44}{100} = \frac{11}{25}
\]</span> with the smallest natural <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s invert all the fractions and subtract their common integer part: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{n}{43} - 2 &gt; \frac{m}{11} &gt; \frac{25}{11} - 2
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\frac{n-86}{43} &gt; \frac{m}{11} &gt; \frac{3}{11}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\frac{11(n-86)}{43} &gt; m &gt; 3
\]</span> Let’s do the same thing again: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{m-3(n-2m)} = \frac{1}{7m-3n} \le \frac{2}{3}
\]</span> and one more time: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{14}{n-2m} &gt; \frac{3}{7m-3n} &gt; 2
\]</span> Notice that here, for the first time, integers appear between the bounds of the inequality. The smallest of them is the number 2. The system of equations <span class="math inline">\(n-2m=2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(7m-3n=1\)</span> has a solution in natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(n=16\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m=7\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s prove that this is the solution to the problem. From inequalities (2)–(4) it follows that <span class="math display">\[
n-2m &gt; 0, \quad 7m-3n \ge 1, \quad n-2m \ge 2
\]</span> Therefore <span class="math display">\[
n = 7(n-2m) + 2(7m-3n) \ge 7 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 1 = 16
\]</span> ∇ Analyzing this solution, we notice that, in essence, we are expanding the numbers <span class="math inline">\(\frac{43}{100}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{11}{25}\)</span> into continued fractions: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{43}{100} = \frac{1}{2+\frac{14}{43}} = \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{3+\frac{1}{14}}}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\frac{11}{25} = \frac{1}{2+\frac{3}{11}} = \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{3+\frac{2}{3}}}
\]</span> Then we take the common part of these expansions at the step where the expansions differ, between <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{14}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span> we insert the smallest integer, i.e.&nbsp;1, and as a result we get the answer: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{3+1}} = \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{4}{9} = \frac{16}{36}
\]</span> This algorithm allows you to quickly find a fraction <span class="math inline">\(\frac{m}{n}\)</span> with the smallest denominator <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> in any given interval <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \frac{m}{n} &lt; \beta\)</span> (see [61, 119]).</p>
<p>Problem 4-7. Answer: The maximum distance is 620454/11 km. Tires need to be changed so that each of them is front for one third of the way.</p>
<p>Let’s take as a unit the amount of rubber that can be worn out on one tire before it becomes unusable. Then, before the trip, there are 6 units of rubber in total. From the condition, it follows that for 1 km of the path, 1/15000 units are erased if the tire is in front, and 1/25000 if it is in the back. This means that for 1 km of the path, 2/15000 + 4/25000 = 11/37500 units of rubber are erased. Let the car have travelled x km. Then 11x/37500 units of rubber have been erased. Since no more than 6 units can be erased, we have <span class="math display">\[
\frac{11x}{37500} \le 6
\]</span> from where <span class="math display">\[
x \le \frac{20454}{11} \times 6
\]</span> To drive all 20454/11 km, it is necessary to change the tires so that each of them is in front for a third of this distance: then they will all wear out simultaneously - by the end of the journey.</p>
<p>Problem 4-8. Answer: 12 minutes.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that if the Kid and Carlson want to eat breakfast in the shortest possible time, then they must start and finish eating at the same time - otherwise, one of them can help the other and reduce the time spent.</p>
<p>Let us denote by x, y, z the shares of cake, jam and milk that the Kid ate; then (1-x), (1-y), (1-z) are the shares of these products that Carlson ate, and the time they spent is equal to <span class="math display">\[
t = 10x + 13y + 14z = 6(1-x) + 6(1-y) + 7(1-z)
\]</span> Thus, we come to the following problem: find the minimum value of the quantity t = 10x + 13y + 14z, if the numbers x, y, z satisfy the conditions 0≤x≤1, 0≤y≤1, 0≤z≤1 and <span class="math display">\[
10x + 13y + 14z = 6(1-x) + 6(1-y) + 7(1-z)
\]</span> From the last relation, one can express z in terms of x and y: <span class="math display">\[
z = \frac{1}{21}(19 - 16x - 19y)
\]</span> Substituting this expression into the formula for t, we get <span class="math display">\[
t = -\frac{2}{3}x + \frac{1}{3}y + \frac{38}{3}
\]</span> From this formula, we see that <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> will be smaller the larger <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is and the smaller <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is. Let’s take the largest possible value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the smallest possible value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(x=1, y=0\)</span>. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(t=12\)</span> minutes, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is within the permissible limits. Consequently, the minimum value of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is achieved in the case when the Kid eats the cake and drinks the milk, and Carlson eats all the jam and drinks the milk.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> We have reduced problem 4-8 to a linear programming problem: find the minimum of a linear function under the condition that the variables are non-negative and satisfy a system of linear inequalities and equations.</p>
<p>If it were required to solve a similar problem for <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 3\)</span> products, then such a solution method would lead to rather cumbersome calculations; however, it is possible to specify a simple general rule that indicates the optimal plan for the distribution of products.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> be the time it takes for the Kid to eat the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th product, and <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> be the time it takes for Carlson to eat it; we will assume that the products are numbered in ascending order of the ratios of these times: <span class="math display">\[\frac{a_1}{b_1} \le \frac{a_2}{b_2} \le ... \le \frac{a_n}{b_n}. \quad (1)\]</span> The plan, in which the breakfast time will be the smallest, is as follows: the Kid starts with the first product and eats them further in the order of numbers, and Carlson starts simultaneously with him from the last product and eats them in reverse order.</p>
<p>In our problem, three products should be ordered as follows: the first is the cake, the second is the milk, the third is the jam. The ratios of times will then satisfy the inequalities <span class="math display">\[\frac{10}{6} \le \frac{4}{7} \le \frac{13}{6}.\]</span> In the first 6 minutes, Carlson eats the jam, and the Kid eats part of the cake. In the next 4 minutes, the Kid finishes the cake, and Carlson drinks <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4}{7}\)</span> of the milk. And finally, in the last 2 minutes, they both finish the milk.</p>
<p>To prove the optimality of the proposed plan, it is convenient to introduce a conditional measure for each product. We will consider the nutritional value of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th product to be equal to <span class="math inline">\((a_i + b_i)\)</span> calories, then the eating rate (calories per unit of time) when eating the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th product for the Kid is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a_i+b_i}{a_i} = 1 + \frac{b_i}{a_i}\)</span>, and for Carlson <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a_i+b_i}{b_i} = 1 + \frac{a_i}{b_i}\)</span>. We see that the Kid’s speed is greater the smaller <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\)</span> is, and Carlson’s speed is the opposite. Thus, in order to get as many calories as possible in time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the Kid should eat the products in the order of numbers, and Carlson in the reverse order. Let the Kid and Carlson get all <span class="math inline">\((a_1 + b_1) + ... + (a_n + b_n)\)</span> calories in some time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> according to our plan. Then, with any other plan, in the same time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, they will receive fewer calories, which means they will not be able to eat all the products.</p>
<p>You can specify a graphical procedure that gives the answer. Let’s draw in the second quarter of the coordinate plane <span class="math inline">\(Oxy\)</span> a broken line whose links are vectors with coordinates <span class="math inline">\((b_1, a_1), (b_2, a_2), ..., (b_n, a_n)\)</span>, going in such an order that inequalities (1) are satisfied; the beginning <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> of this broken line lies on the <span class="math inline">\(Ox\)</span> axis, the end <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> on the <span class="math inline">\(Oy\)</span> axis (Fig. 47 corresponds to the case <span class="math inline">\(n = 3\)</span>; in problem 4-8, the three vectors that make up the broken line have coordinates <span class="math inline">\((6, 10), (7, 14)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((6, 13)\)</span>).</p>

<p>Let’s mark the point <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> of intersection of this broken line with the bisector <span class="math inline">\(x + y = 0\)</span> of the second coordinate quarter. The ordinate <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> of the point <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> indicates the desired minimal time, and the part <span class="math inline">\(ML\)</span> of the broken line indicates the products that Malysh eats, and the part <span class="math inline">\(LK\)</span> indicates the products that Karlsson eats.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-9.</strong> Answer: 10 or 11 trains.</p>
<p>Let the trains depart with an interval of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> minutes. Since in 12 minutes 4 full intervals have definitely passed, <span class="math inline">\(4T \le 12\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(T \le 3\)</span>. Since no more than <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> minutes have passed before the departure of the first of the 5 trains and after the departure of the last of them, <span class="math inline">\(T + 4T + T &gt; 12\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(T &gt; 2\)</span>. So, <span class="math inline">\(2 &lt; T \le 3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, from the fact that exactly 6 trains departed in 20 minutes, we get <span class="math inline">\(\frac{20}{7} &lt; T \le 4\)</span>. From these inequalities it follows that <span class="math inline">\(2 &lt; T \le 3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> trains depart in 30 minutes. Then, similarly, we get <span class="math inline">\((n-1)T \le 30 &lt; (n+1)T\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\frac{30}{T} - 1 &lt; n \le \frac{30}{T} + 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Taking into account that <span class="math inline">\(2 &lt; T \le 3\)</span>, we find that <span class="math inline">\(9 &lt; n \le 11\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(n = 10\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(n = 11\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(T = 3\)</span> and the first train departs immediately upon Vitya’s arrival, then 11 trains will depart in 30 minutes, and if with the same <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> the first train departs 1 minute after his arrival, then 10 trains will depart in 30 minutes, i.e., both answer options are realized.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> The solution to this problem is related to the following general question. Let points be placed on a straight line at equal distances <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> from each other. What is the number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of these points that a segment of length <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> can contain?</p>
<p>Answer: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{b}{T} - 1 &lt; n \le \frac{b}{T} + 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-10.</strong> Answer: 5 three-ton trucks.</p>
<p>Let’s first show that 4 three-ton trucks may not be enough. Let’s take 13 identical boxes weighing <span class="math inline">\(\frac{10}{13}\)</span> tons each. Then we cannot put more than three boxes in one three-ton truck, and no more than 12 boxes in four trucks.</p>
<p>Now let’s prove that 5 three-ton trucks are always enough. Indeed, we can load at least two tons of cargo into each three-ton truck (if less than two tons are loaded, we can add another box). Then at least 10 tons can be loaded into 5 three-ton trucks.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> A more general problem. Several boxes weigh a total of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> tons, and each of them weighs no more than 1 ton. What is the minimum number of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-ton trucks (<span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 1\)</span>) that is definitely enough to carry all this cargo at once?</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = \frac{p}{[p] + 1}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\([p]\)</span> is the integer part of the number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Then the answer is the smallest integer <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{T - \gamma}{p - \gamma}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the example showing that a smaller number of trucks may not be enough, it is necessary to take all the loads equal (and slightly larger than <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>). You can load <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> trucks in descending order of their masses. For the proof, it is convenient to use the following lemma: if there are several boxes with a total mass of more than <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> tons (each is no more than 1), then you can load more than <span class="math inline">\(p - \gamma\)</span> tons onto a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-ton truck. In problem 4-10, <span class="math inline">\(p = 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T = 10\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = \frac{3}{4}\)</span>; it follows from the lemma that more than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{9}{4}\)</span> tons can be loaded onto one three-ton truck, and the weight of the cargo, 10 tons, as we know, can be transported on 5 three-ton trucks; this is exactly the smallest integer greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{T - \gamma}{p - \gamma} = \frac{37}{9}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For experts. It is interesting to compare this problem with the “stone problem” often encountered in applications. There are several stones with known masses <span class="math inline">\(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\)</span> and a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-ton truck (<span class="math inline">\(p, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\)</span> are natural numbers). The question is whether it is possible to select several of these stones so as to completely load the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-ton truck with them. In other words, are there such numbers <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)</span>, equal to 0 or 1, that the equality <span class="math inline">\(a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = p\)</span> is satisfied?</p>
<p>The latter problem belongs to the class of so-called universal enumeration problems. There is no known algorithm for solving them that works significantly faster than brute-force enumeration of all options. (Unlike this problem, loading boxes, which was discussed in the generalization of problem 4-10, can be done very quickly; see [97].)</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-11. Answer: either all three numbers are equal to zero, or one of them is equal to zero, and the other two are ones.</strong></p>
<p>Note that all three numbers are non-negative, since each of them is a square. Let’s denote them in descending order as follows: <span class="math display">\[x \ge y \ge z \ge 0.\]</span> Then <span class="math inline">\(x - z \ge y - z \ge 0\)</span>, whence <span class="math inline">\((x - z)^2 \ge (y - z)^2\)</span>. But <span class="math inline">\((x - z)^2 = y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((y - z)^2 = x\)</span>. So, on the one hand, <span class="math inline">\(x \ge y\)</span>, on the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(y \ge x\)</span>, and thus <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>. In this case, we get <span class="math inline">\(z = 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x = x^2\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> Inequalities were not involved in the condition of this problem, but they appeared in the solution. The idea of ordering equal unknowns helps in many other situations as well.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-12.</strong> Note that <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> enter symmetrically into the condition of the problem, so we can assume that <span class="math inline">\(m \ge n \ge 2\)</span>. In this case, <span class="math inline">\(m^n \le n^n\)</span>. Thus, it is sufficient to prove the inequality <span class="math inline">\(n^n \le 3^3\)</span> or <span class="math display">\[n^{\frac{1}{n}} \le 3^{\frac{1}{3}}.\]</span> (1) If <span class="math inline">\(n = 2\)</span>, the inequality <span class="math inline">\(2^{\frac{1}{2}} \le 3^{\frac{1}{3}}\)</span> is true, since when both sides are raised to the sixth power, we get <span class="math inline">\(8 &lt; 9\)</span>. Now let’s take the natural logarithm of both sides of inequality (1) and prove that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\ln n}{n} \le \frac{\ln 3}{3}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 3\)</span>.</p>
<p>The derivative of the function <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\ln x}{x}\)</span> is negative for <span class="math inline">\(x \ge 3\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\left(\frac{\ln x}{x}\right)' = \frac{(1 - \ln x)}{x^2} &lt; 0,\]</span> since <span class="math inline">\(\ln x &gt; 1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x \ge 3 &gt; e\)</span>.</p>
<p>Hence it follows that the function <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\ln x}{x}\)</span> is decreasing for <span class="math inline">\(x \ge 3\)</span> and, consequently, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\ln x}{x} \le \frac{\ln 3}{3}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x \ge 3\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> The inequality <span class="math inline">\(n^{\frac{1}{n}} \le 3^{\frac{1}{3}}\)</span> for natural <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 3\)</span> can also be proved by induction; if it is true for some <span class="math inline">\(n = k\)</span>, then it is also true for the next <span class="math inline">\(n = k + 1\)</span>: the inequality <span class="math inline">\((k + 1)^{\frac{1}{k+1}} \le 3^{\frac{1}{3}}\)</span> is obtained from <span class="math inline">\(k^{\frac{1}{k}} \le 3^{\frac{1}{3}}\)</span> by multiplying term by term by the true (for <span class="math inline">\(k \ge 3\)</span>) inequality <span class="math inline">\(\left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \le 3^{\frac{1}{3}}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-13.</strong> Answer: the smallest value is reached at <span class="math inline">\(n = 10^{10} - 1\)</span> and at <span class="math inline">\(n = 10^{10}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(a_n = \frac{\lg 2 \cdot \lg 3 \cdot ... \cdot \lg n}{n}\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(a_n = \left(\frac{\lg n}{10}\right)^{a_n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\lg n &lt; 10\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(a_n &lt; a_{n-1}\)</span>; if <span class="math inline">\(\lg n = 10\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(a_n = a_{n-1}\)</span>; if <span class="math inline">\(\lg n &gt; 10\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(a_n &gt; a_{n-1}\)</span>. Thus, the sequence <span class="math inline">\((a_n)\)</span> decreases up to <span class="math inline">\(n = 10^{10} - 1\)</span>, then has two equal terms with numbers <span class="math inline">\(10^{10} - 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(10^{10}\)</span>, and starting from the next number, the sequence increases.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-14.</strong> Answer: The maximum value is 1/4.</p>
<p>This value is achieved, for example, when <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = x_2 = 1/2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_3 = x_4 = x_5 = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s show that <span class="math inline">\(x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_3x_4 + x_4x_5 \leq 1/4\)</span> for all non-negative values of <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\)</span>. Indeed,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + x_3x_4 + x_4x_5 \leq (x_1 + x_3 + x_5)(x_2 + x_4)\)</span>,</p>
<p>because if we expand the brackets on the right side, we get all the terms on the left side, plus several non-negative terms.</p>
<p>Now it’s sufficient to apply the inequality between geometric and arithmetic means to two numbers, <span class="math inline">\(u = x_1 + x_3 + x_5 \geq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v = x_2 + x_4 \geq 0\)</span>, which sum to one:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(uv \leq (\frac{u+v}{2})^2 = (\frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{4}\)</span></p>
<p>Thus,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\((x_1 + x_3 + x_5)(x_2 + x_4) = uv \leq \frac{(u+v)^2}{4} = \frac{1}{4}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> Similarly, it can be proved that for any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> non-negative numbers <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)</span> that add up to 1, the largest value of the quantity <span class="math inline">\(x_1x_2 + x_2x_3 + ... + x_{n-1}x_n\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-15.</strong> To prove, we compare the left and right sides of the inequality given in the condition with the expression <span class="math inline">\(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2\)</span>: we will prove that <span class="math display">\[a^4 + b^4 + c^4 \ge a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2 \ge a^2bc + b^2ac + c^2ab.\]</span> Adding term by term three valid inequalities <span class="math inline">\(a^4 + b^4 - 2a^2b^2 \ge 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b^4 + c^4 - 2b^2c^2 \ge 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c^4 + a^4 - 2a^2c^2 \ge 0\)</span>, we get <span class="math inline">\(2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) \ge 2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2)\)</span>. Adding term by term three valid inequalities <span class="math inline">\(a^2(b^2 + c^2 - 2bc) \ge 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b^2(a^2 + c^2 - 2ac) \ge 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c^2(b^2 + a^2 - 2ba) \ge 0\)</span>, we get <span class="math display">\[2(a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + a^2c^2) \ge 2(a^2bc + b^2ac + c^2ab).\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> The following general Muirhead’s theorem is related to the inequality from problem 4-15.

<p>It has the following visual interpretation: if the sets of exponents are depicted as stairs, in which the width of the steps is equal to 1, and the height is the numbers of the set, then the second set should be obtained from the first by cutting off pieces of steps and throwing them down to the right (to one of the following steps). In problem 4-15 (Fig. 48), (2, 2, 0) is obtained from the set (4, 0, 0), and (2, 1, 1) is obtained from it: <span class="math display">\[(4, 0, 0) \succ (2, 2, 0) \succ (2, 1, 1).\]</span> The operation of “throwing steps” suggests a way to prove any of the inequalities referred to in Muirhead’s theorem (see [102]).</p>
<p>Figures of several cells that have the shape of stairs turn out to be convenient in many other combinatorial and algebraic problems (see problem 6-10).</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-16.</strong> To get rid of the radicals, let <span class="math inline">\(x = b^{\frac{1}{15}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y = a^{\frac{1}{10}}\)</span>. Then the given inequality will take the form <span class="math display">\[3x^5 + 2y^5 - 5x^3y^2 \ge 0.\]</span> Dividing both sides of the inequality by <span class="math inline">\(y^5\)</span> and denoting <span class="math inline">\(\frac{x}{y}\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we get the equivalent inequality <span class="math display">\[3t^5 - 5t^3 + 2 \ge 0.\]</span> The left side is factored: <span class="math display">\[(t-1)^2(3t^3 + 6t^2 + 4t + 2) \ge 0.\]</span> For <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; 0\)</span>, both factors are non-negative, so the inequality is true. It turns into equality only for <span class="math inline">\(t = 1\)</span>, i.e., for <span class="math inline">\(a = b\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> You can prove the original inequality using the inequality between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean for five numbers: <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{5}(3\sqrt[15]{b} + 3\sqrt[15]{b} + 3\sqrt[15]{b} + 2\sqrt[10]{a} + 2\sqrt[10]{a})^5 \ge 5(3\sqrt[15]{b})^3 \cdot (2\sqrt[10]{a})^2 = 108 \sqrt[5]{ab}.\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, it can be proved that for any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> positive numbers <span class="math inline">\(a_1, a_2, ..., a_k\)</span> and natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(p_1, p_2, ..., p_k\)</span> with the sum <span class="math inline">\(p_1 + ... + p_k = p\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\frac{p_1 a_1^{p_1} + p_2 a_2^{p_2} + ... + p_k a_k^{p_k}}{p} \ge (a_1 a_2 ... a_k)^{\frac{p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_k}{p}}.\]</span> And here is another proof (leading to a different generalization).</p>
<p>Putting <span class="math inline">\(a = y^{\frac{5}{3}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b = x^{\frac{5}{2}}\)</span>, we reduce the original inequality to the form <span class="math display">\[3x^{\frac{5}{2}} + 2y^{\frac{5}{3}} \ge 5xy.\]</span> This is a special case of Young’s inequality: for any positive <span class="math inline">\(x, y, \alpha, \beta\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\alpha} + \frac{1}{\beta} = 1\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\frac{x^\alpha}{\alpha} + \frac{y^\beta}{\beta} \ge xy.\]</span> This, in turn, is a special case of the inequality <span class="math inline">\(f(x) + g(y) \ge xy\)</span>, (*) where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are differentiable functions defined for all non-negative values of the argument, for which <span class="math inline">\(f'\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g'\)</span> are mutually inverse monotonically increasing functions, and <span class="math display">\[f(0) = g(0) = f'(0) = g'(0) = 0\]</span> (the functions <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are called dual according to Young).</p>
<p>Note that for each value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> there is exactly one value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> for which the inequality (*) turns into an equality; for these values <span class="math inline">\(y = f'(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x = g'(y)\)</span>. Therefore, the function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> can be defined through the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as follows: for each <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[g(k) = \max_x (kx - f(x)).\]</span> Such a transition from the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to the function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is called the Legendre transform of the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. In this case, the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> will, in turn, be the Legendre transform of the function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> – see Figure 49 (see [79]).</p>

<p>Consider six triangles, which together with the triangle <span class="math inline">\(KLM\)</span> make up the hexagon <span class="math inline">\(ABCDEF\)</span> – in our figure, these are triangles <span class="math inline">\(ABL, BCL, CDM, DEM, EFK, FAK\)</span> (Fig. 50, b). The area of at least one of them is not greater than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{S}{6}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the area of the hexagon (otherwise, the sum of these six areas would be greater than <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, which is impossible). Let, for example, <span class="math inline">\(S_{ABL} \le \frac{S}{6}\)</span> (Fig. 50, c). We claim that then the area of one of the triangles <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ABF\)</span> with the same base <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> is not greater than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{S}{6}\)</span>. Indeed, the area of a triangle with base <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span> and height <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{AB \cdot h}{2}\)</span>, and the height of triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABL\)</span> is enclosed between the heights of triangles <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ABF\)</span>, i.e., it is not greater than one of them.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> In the last reasoning, one can single out a frequently encountered consideration: the largest value of a linear function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> defined on some interval <span class="math inline">\([a; b]\)</span> is always reached at one of the ends of the interval, i.e., for any <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, the value of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> does not exceed <span class="math inline">\(f(a)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(f(b)\)</span>. In our problem, such a function was the area of the triangle <span class="math inline">\(f(h) = \frac{AB \cdot h}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-18.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \le \beta \le \gamma\)</span>. Considering <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> as fixed, let’s consider the derivative with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> of the difference between the right and left sides. It is equal to <span class="math display">\[\left(3 \sin \frac{\alpha + \beta + \gamma}{3} - \sin \alpha - \sin \beta - \sin \gamma \right)' = \cos \frac{\alpha + \beta + \gamma}{3} - \cos \gamma \ge 0,\]</span> since <span class="math inline">\(0 \le \frac{\alpha + \beta + \gamma}{3} \le \gamma \le \pi\)</span> and for <span class="math inline">\(t \in [0; \pi]\)</span> the function <span class="math inline">\(y = \cos t\)</span> is decreasing (the derivatives of the constants <span class="math inline">\(\sin \alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sin \beta\)</span> are equal to 0). If we prove the validity of our inequality for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma = \beta\)</span>, then it will also be valid for <span class="math inline">\(\gamma \ge \beta\)</span> – with the growth of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, the difference between the right and left sides of the inequality will increase. So, it remains to prove that for all <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \le \beta\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\sin \alpha + 2 \sin \beta \le 3 \sin \frac{\alpha + 2\beta}{3}.\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s repeat the same reasoning. The derivative with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> of the difference between the right and left sides is equal to <span class="math display">\[2 \cos \frac{\alpha + 2\beta}{3} - 2 \cos \beta \ge 0,\]</span> since <span class="math inline">\(0 \le \frac{\alpha + 2\beta}{3} \le \beta \le \pi\)</span>. But for <span class="math inline">\(\beta = \alpha\)</span>, the inequality turns into an equality. Therefore, it is true for <span class="math inline">\(\beta \ge \alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> Taking <span class="math inline">\(\alpha + \beta + \gamma = \pi\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 2\pi\)</span> in the condition of the problem, we get inequalities equivalent to the fact that the perimeter and area of any triangle are not greater than those of a regular triangle with the same radius of the circumscribed circle.</p>
<p>The method by which this problem is solved allows us to prove the following general theorem. Let a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> be defined on the interval <span class="math inline">\([a; b]\)</span>, whose derivative <span class="math inline">\(f'(x)\)</span> does not increase (such a function is called convex upward). Then for any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> points <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\)</span> on this interval and for any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> positive numbers <span class="math inline">\(p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\)</span> with the sum <span class="math inline">\(p_1 + ... + p_n = 1\)</span>, the following Jensen’s inequality holds: <span class="math display">\[f(p_1x_1 + ... + p_nx_n) \ge p_1f(x_1) + ... + p_nf(x_n).\]</span> In our problem, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \sin x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \in [0; \pi]\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \frac{1}{3}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we take the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \ln x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_1 = p_2 = ... = p_n = \frac{1}{n}\)</span>, then we get the inequality <span class="math display">\[\frac{x_1 + ... + x_n}{n} \ge \sqrt[n]{x_1 ... x_n},\]</span> or <span class="math display">\[\ln \frac{x_1 + ... + x_n}{n} \ge \frac{\ln x_1 + ... + \ln x_n}{n} \ge \ln \sqrt[n]{x_1 ... x_n},\]</span> – the classical inequality between the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> numbers (<span class="math inline">\(x_1 &gt; 0, ..., x_n &gt; 0\)</span>).</p>
<p>For the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = -x^2\)</span>, we get the inequality <span class="math display">\[(p_1x_1 + ... + p_nx_n)^2 \le p_1x_1^2 + ... + p_nx_n^2;\]</span> and from it, putting <span class="math inline">\(x_k = a_kb_k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_k = \frac{b_k^2}{(b_1^2 + ... + b_n^2)}\)</span>, we can derive the Cauchy-Bunyakovsky inequality: <span class="math display">\[(a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n)^2 \le (a_1^2 + a_2^2 + ... + a_n^2)(b_1^2 + b_2^2 + ... + b_n^2),\]</span> according to which the scalar product of two vectors is not greater than the product of their lengths (in our proof it was important that all <span class="math inline">\(b_k\)</span> are different from zero, but the last inequality is obviously true without this assumption) – see [80].</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> It can be proved that the largest in area among all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gons with given lengths <span class="math inline">\(a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}\)</span> of consecutive sides (except for one, <span class="math inline">\(AZ\)</span>) will be the one whose vertices all lie on a semicircle with diameter <span class="math inline">\(AZ\)</span>.

<p>If all the lengths of the sides of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gon are known, then the largest in area will be (the only one – if the order of the sides is fixed) inscribed in a circle.

<p><strong>Problem 4-20. Answer: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{2}\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>A convex polyhedron with 5 vertices cannot be anything other than the union of two tetrahedra (triangular pyramids) with a common base (Fig. 52). Indeed, it has such a vertex from which 4 edges emerge to all other vertices (if only 3 edges emerged from each vertex, then there would be a total of <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 3 = 15\)</span> ends of the edges, but each edge has two ends, so there would be <span class="math inline">\(\frac{15}{2}\)</span> edges, which is impossible). Let these vertices be <span class="math inline">\(A, B, C, D\)</span>, and let the edges emerge from vertex <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> to them. Then the polyhedron is the union of two tetrahedra <span class="math inline">\(EABC\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(EBCD\)</span> with a common face <span class="math inline">\(EBC\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S_{ABC}\)</span> be the area of triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(h_E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h_D\)</span> be the heights of the tetrahedra <span class="math inline">\(EABC\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(DABC\)</span> dropped from vertices <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> onto the plane <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>. Then the sum of the volumes of these tetrahedra is equal to <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} h_E + \frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} h_D = \frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} (h_E + h_D).\]</span> Similarly, if we consider the tetrahedra <span class="math inline">\(EABD\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ECBD\)</span> with a common face <span class="math inline">\(EBD\)</span>, then the sum of their volumes is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3} S_{ABD} (h_E + h_C)\)</span>.

<p>Indeed, it has such a vertex from which 4 edges emerge to all other vertices (if only 3 edges emerged from each vertex, then there would be a total of <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 3 = 15\)</span> ends of edges, but this number is equal to the doubled number of all edges and should be even). If <span class="math inline">\(AB, AD, AC\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(AE\)</span> are four consecutive edges of a tetrahedral angle with vertex <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then our polyhedron is the union of tetrahedra <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ABCE\)</span> with a common base <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>. Let’s estimate the volume of the polyhedron: <span class="math display">\[V = \frac{S(h_D + h_E)}{3},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(h_D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h_E\)</span> are the heights of the tetrahedra, dropped respectively from vertices <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> onto the base <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is the area of triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> be the intersection point of the segment <span class="math inline">\(DE\)</span> with the plane <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>; then <span class="math inline">\(h_D + h_E \le DK + KE = DE \le 2\)</span>, since the distance between any two points on a sphere is not greater than its diameter. Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be the radius of the circle circumscribed around triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> (i.e., the section of the sphere by the plane <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>). Then (see problem 4-18 or 4-19) <span class="math display">\[S \le \frac{3\sqrt{3}R^2}{4} \le \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4},\]</span> since the radius of any section of the sphere is not greater than the radius of the sphere. So, <span class="math inline">\(V \le \frac{3}{2}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(V = \frac{3}{2}\)</span> in the case when <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> is a regular triangle inscribed in the equator, and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> are the poles of the sphere.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> The general problem: among all polyhedra inscribed in a sphere with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices, find the polyhedron of maximum volume – is very difficult.</p>
<p>It can be shown that for <span class="math inline">\(n = 6\)</span>, such a polyhedron will be a regular octahedron, but for <span class="math inline">\(n = 8\)</span>, the polyhedron of the largest volume will not be a cube. For the planar analogue of this problem, the situation is much simpler: the largest in area inscribed in a given circle <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gon for each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is, obviously, regular (this is a simple consequence of the convexity of the sine on the interval from 0 to <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, see the discussion of problem 4-18).</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-21.</strong> Consider unit squares centered at all the nodes of the grid that are inside a circle of radius 10 (the sides of the squares are parallel to the grid lines).</p>
<p>Since the length of the diagonal of such a square is <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2} &lt; 2\)</span>, all these squares cover a circle of radius 9, concentric with the given circle. Therefore, the sum of their areas (numerically equal to the number of grid nodes) is greater than <span class="math inline">\(81\pi\)</span> – the area of a circle of radius 9. <span class="math inline">\(81\pi &gt; 251\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> We can formulate a more general problem: estimate the number of solutions in integers <span class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span> of the inequality <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 &lt; n\)</span> (in our problem, <span class="math inline">\(n = 100\)</span>). From our reasoning, it follows that the number of solutions is not less than <span class="math inline">\(\pi(n-1)\)</span> (see [91]).</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-22. Answer: impossible.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s draw a sphere of radius <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> centered at the given point <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>. For each ray, we construct a conical surface with vertex <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>, whose axis is this ray, and the angle of the generatrix with the axis is <span class="math inline">\(30^\circ\)</span>; consider the “cap” – the part of the sphere lying inside this cone. The area of this “cap” (spherical segment) is equal to <span class="math inline">\(2\pi Rh\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is the height of the “cap”: <span class="math display">\[h = R(1 - \cos 30^\circ) = R\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right),\]</span> so the ratio of the area of the “cap” to the area <span class="math inline">\(4\pi R^2\)</span> of the entire sphere is equal to <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) &gt; \frac{1}{15}.\]</span> (The last inequality is equivalent to the following: <span class="math inline">\((2 - \sqrt{3})^{15} &gt; 4\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(26 &gt; 15\sqrt{3}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2^{12} = 4096 &gt; 15^2 \cdot 3 = 675\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Thus, some two of the 15 “caps” corresponding to 15 rays will necessarily intersect, and therefore, some two rays form an angle less than <span class="math inline">\(60^\circ\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> We can pose a more general question: what is the largest value <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> that the smallest of the angles between <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> rays emanating from one point in space can take (or, equivalently, what is the largest size that <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> identical non-intersecting “caps” on a sphere can have)? The exact answer to this question is known only for <span class="math inline">\(n \le 9\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n = 12\)</span>, although good estimates for the value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_n\)</span> have been obtained for many values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-23.</strong> Let’s mark points on the circles: on the first – <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, on the second – <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. We will specify the position of the second circle relative to the first when they are superimposed by the angular value <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> of the arc <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0^\circ \le t &lt; 360^\circ\)</span> (the count goes counterclockwise).</p>
<p>Let’s call the value of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> forbidden if, with the corresponding arrangement of the circles, at least one pair of marked arcs intersects.</p>
<p>Consider some arc of <span class="math inline">\(25^\circ\)</span> and some arc of <span class="math inline">\(30^\circ\)</span>. They intersect on some interval of values of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> of magnitude <span class="math inline">\(55^\circ\)</span>. In total, there are no more such forbidden segments than pairs of arcs, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(3 \cdot 2 = 6\)</span>. Therefore, the set of forbidden values of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> has a total value of no more than <span class="math inline">\(6 \cdot 55^\circ = 330^\circ\)</span> and does not cover the entire set of values of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> – from <span class="math inline">\(0^\circ\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(360^\circ\)</span>.</p>
<p>This means that there are also non-forbidden values of <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for which no pair of arcs intersects.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> Similarly, it can be proved that if non-overlapping arcs <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_m\)</span> are marked on one unit circle, and arcs <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n\)</span> are marked on the other, and <span class="math display">\[m(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + ... + \alpha_m) + n(\beta_1 + \beta_2 + ... + \beta_n) &lt; 360^\circ,\]</span> then the circles can be aligned so that the marked arcs do not intersect.</p>
<p>An interesting and in some sense “reverse” question is: under what conditions on the numbers <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_m, \beta_1, ..., \beta_n\)</span> is it possible to arrange the corresponding arcs so that some arcs overlap for any superposition of the circles?</p>
<p>Note also that the method of our solution to problem 4-23 can be called a continuous analogue of the Dirichlet principle (see problem 2-9); and they have a common drawback: this method does not show how to find the required method of superposition.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 4-24.</strong> Let’s carry out the weighing of the weights in three stages.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Take two weights out of five and compare them. Let their masses be <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b\)</span>. Take two more weights and compare them: <span class="math inline">\(c &lt; d\)</span>. Then compare the heavier weights of these pairs; we can assume that <span class="math inline">\(b &lt; d\)</span>.</li>
<li>Find the place of the fifth weight with mass <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> among the three <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b &lt; d\)</span>. Two weighings are enough for this: first, you need to compare <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, then you need to compare <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(e &lt; b\)</span>, and with <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(e &gt; b\)</span>. Now we know how the four weights <span class="math inline">\(a, b, d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> are ordered.</li>
<li>Find the place of the weight with mass <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> among the three weights <span class="math inline">\(a, b, e\)</span>; this will also take two weighings. Since after stage 1 we know that <span class="math inline">\(c &lt; d\)</span>, thus we will find the place of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> among the four remaining weights.</li>
</ol>
<p>At stage 1, we made three weighings, at stages 2 and 3 – two weighings each, i.e., a total of 7 weighings.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> We will prove that it is impossible to order 5 weights in less than 7 weighings. Indeed, there are a total of <span class="math inline">\(5! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120\)</span> options for ordering five weights. Each weighing has two outcomes. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> weighings can make a choice of no more than <span class="math inline">\(2^p\)</span> options. (In the worst case for us, after the next weighing, the number of possible options is reduced by no more than half.) Therefore, in order for 5 weights to be ordered in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> weighings, the inequality <span class="math inline">\(2^p \ge 120\)</span> must be satisfied, or <span class="math inline">\(p \ge \log_2 120\)</span>, whence <span class="math inline">\(p \ge 7\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the general case, to order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> weights, at least <span class="math inline">\(\log_2(n!)\)</span> weighings are definitely needed.</p>
<p>The general problem of the minimum number <span class="math inline">\(F(n)\)</span> of weighings for which <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> weights can be ordered is far from being completely solved and is of great interest to programming specialists.</p>
<p>Several general methods for ordering <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> weights have been invented, but for large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the number of weighings in all these methods exceeds <span class="math inline">\([\log_2(n!)] + 1\)</span>. The simplest of them is the so-called “binary insertion” algorithm. At the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th stage of this algorithm (<span class="math inline">\(k = 1, 2, ..., n-1\)</span>), some new <span class="math inline">\((k+1)\)</span>-th weight is taken and its place is found among the chain of already ordered <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> weights. First, it is compared in mass with the weight standing in the middle of this chain, then – with the weight in the middle of the half of the chain in which it turned out to be, and so on. At the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th stage, no more than <span class="math inline">\([\log_2 k] + 1\)</span> weighings are spent. Thus, we can order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> weights in no more than <span class="math display">\[(1 + \log_2 2) + (1 + \log_2 3) + ... + (1 + \log_2(n-1)) &lt; n(1 + \log_2 n)\]</span> weighings.</p>
<p>So, the minimum number <span class="math inline">\(F(n)\)</span> of weighings satisfies the inequalities <span class="math display">\[\log_2(n!) \le F(n) &lt; n(1 + \log_2 n).\]</span> Only for <span class="math inline">\(n \le 4\)</span> does the “binary insertion” algorithm give the correct values of <span class="math inline">\(F(n)\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(F(2) = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F(3) = 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F(4) = 5\)</span>. For the case <span class="math inline">\(n = 5\)</span>, it requires 8, not <span class="math inline">\(F(5) = 7\)</span> weighings. A generalization of the weighing method that was indicated in the solution to the problem about five weights (the “insertion and merge” sorting algorithm [94]) gives the smallest possible number <span class="math inline">\(F(n)\)</span> of weighings for <span class="math inline">\(n \le 12\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n = 20, 21\)</span>, but it (as V.S. Grinberg told us) is not optimal for all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
