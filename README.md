# Profound Puzzles: Deep Mathematics through Playful Problems

Welcome to the repository for **Profound Puzzles: Deep Mathematics through Playful Problems**. This project is an online edition and translation of a collection of mathematical puzzles, originally written in Russian by Victor Gutenmacher and co-authors. You can find the original PDF [here](https://github.com/ininteraction/zmo/tree/main/ZMO_PDF). The goal of the book is to deepen mathematical understanding through playful problem-solving. The book is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and is open for contributions from the community.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of new puzzles, improvements to the translation of existing puzzles, illustrations, or any other suggestions to enhance the book, as well as general discussions. There are several ways to contribute:

#### Step 3: Make Changes

Edit the `*.qmd` files located in the repository. Each puzzle or section is written in Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`), which supports both markdown and LaTeX for mathematical typesetting.

#### Step 4: Preview Locally

You can preview your changes locally by running the following command:

```bash
quarto preview
```

This will open a local server where you can see the rendered book with your changes.

#### Step 2: Edit the Files

- Browse the files in your fork on GitHub, and locate the `*.qmd` file you wish to edit.
- Click on the file to open it, then click the pencil icon to edit it directly in the GitHub interface.

#### Step 3: Submit a Pull Request
