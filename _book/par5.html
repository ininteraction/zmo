<h2 data-number="5.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problems-discussion"><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Problems Discussion</h2>
<p>Problem 5-1. a), b). Answer: the train could move non-uniformly, and its average speed is not necessarily equal to 100 km/h. Let’s show this. Let’s divide the entire train travel time into 11 half-hour intervals. Let the train move exactly the same way as in the first half-hour during each odd half-hour, and cover k km during each such half-hour (0 ≤ k ≤ 100), and during each even half-hour, let it move exactly the same way as in the second half-hour, and cover (100−k) km during each even half-hour. Then, no matter how the train moves during the first two half-hours - uniformly or not - the train will cover exactly 100 km during each hour of movement.</p>
<p>To answer question b), let’s find the average speed of the train. The distance traveled by the train during all odd half-hour intervals is equal to 6k, and the distance covered during all even intervals is equal to 5(100−k). Thus, during the entire 5.5 hours of movement, the train covered 6k + 5(100 − k) = 500 + k. Therefore, its average speed is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{500 + k}{5.5}\)</span> (km/h). For k ≠ 50, this speed is not equal to 100 km/h.</p>
<p>∇ In our example, the train’s movement was periodic with a period T = 1 hour. It can be shown that such periodicity of the speed of movement follows from the conditions of the problem. From our reasoning, it can be seen that the average speed of the train can be any number in the interval from 1000/11 (when k = 0) to 1200/11 (when k = 100) km/h.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 5-2.</strong> Answer: it can. Here’s an example:</p>
<p>2; 2; 2; 2; −9; 2; 2; 2; 2; −9; 2; 2.</p>
<p>Here, the differences between the person’s income and expenses (balance) for each month of the year are written in a row (taking into account the sign). We see that the sum of any five consecutive numbers in the written chain is negative (equal to −1), and in general, for the year, the sum of all numbers is positive (equal to 2).</p>
<p>∇ Generalization of this problem: n numbers are written in a row, while the sum of any k adjacent numbers is negative; can the sum of all n numbers be positive in such a situation? The answer here is: if n is a multiple of k, then this cannot be, and if n is not divisible by k, then it can. In our problem, n = 12, k = 5.</p>
<p>This statement can, in turn, also be generalized. Let m numbers be written in a row. Let’s call the sum of q consecutive numbers from this row a q-sum. Then if for natural numbers m, n, and k the inequality <span class="math inline">\(m \le n + k − d − 1\)</span> is satisfied, where <span class="math inline">\(d = gcd(n, k)\)</span> is the greatest common divisor of the numbers n and k, then it is possible to write m numbers in a row so that all its n-sums have one sign, and all k-sums have another sign. Moreover, all these sums can take any pre-specified values.</p>
<p>In fact, let’s compose a system of k + n − 2d linear equations with k + n − d − 1 unknowns:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(x_1 + ... + x_n = a_1,\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(x_2 + ... + x_{n+1} = a_2,\)</span> … <span class="math inline">\(x_{k-d} + ... + x_{k+n-d-1} = a_{k-d},\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + ... + x_k = b_1,\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(x_2 + ... + x_{k+1} = b_2,\)</span> … <span class="math inline">\(x_{n-d} + ... + x_{k+n-d-1} = b_{n-d}.\)</span></p>
<p>It can be shown that this system is consistent: its matrix has the maximum possible rank k + n − 2d. If the numbers n and k are relatively prime (d = 1), then it has a unique solution; if d &gt; 1, then the system has d − 1 free unknowns.</p>
<p>Thus, for given n and k, one can find a row of n + k − d − 1 numbers that satisfy the condition. If <span class="math inline">\(m \le n + k − d − 1\)</span>, then the row formed by the first m numbers of the already written row also satisfies the condition.</p>
<p>Let’s now show that if <span class="math inline">\(m \ge n + k − d\)</span>, then there is no such row of m numbers that all its n-sums have one sign, and all k-sums have another.</p>
<p>Suppose, on the contrary, that such a row of n + k − d numbers has been found, and let n &gt; k. Let’s cross out the first k numbers. Then, in the row of the remaining n − d numbers, all k-sums still have the same sign, and all (n − k)-sums have a different sign. Since</p>
<p>n − d = (n − k) + k − d,</p>
<p>we have moved from the problem with parameters n and k to the problem with smaller numbers: k and n − k. Repeating this procedure (similar to the Euclidean algorithm), we will arrive at a situation where there is a row of numbers in which all d-sums have one sign, and all ld-sums have a different sign, which is obviously impossible. (Note that by a similar procedure – descent from (n, k) to (k, n − k), similar to the Euclidean algorithm, one can also prove the consistency of the system written above.)</p>
<p>Finally, it is clear that if there is no row of n + k − d numbers that satisfies the condition, then it is impossible to write a longer such row.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 5-3.</strong> Answer: it is possible. Indeed:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(203 = 7 + 29 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = 7 \cdot 29 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot ... \cdot 1.\)</span> 167 ones 167 ones</p>
<p>∇ Let’s ask the question: which natural numbers cannot be represented simultaneously as a sum and as a product of several (the same) natural numbers?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is: prime numbers.</p>
<p>The following question related to problem 5-3 is also interesting: for which natural values of k does the equation</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_k = x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot ... \cdot x_k\)</span></p>
<p>have a non-zero integer solution?</p>
<p>It turns out that for all values of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. For example:</p>
<p>for <span class="math inline">\(k = 1\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = 1\)</span>; for <span class="math inline">\(k = 2\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = x_2 = 2\)</span>; for <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; 2\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(x_1 = x_2 = ... = x_{k-2} = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_{k-1} = 2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_k = k\)</span> (see [109], problems 186–189).</p>
<p><strong>Problem 5-4.</strong> Answer: false.</p>
<p>Counterexample: 6, 10, 15, 77, 91, 143.</p>
<p>From these six numbers, <span class="math inline">\(2 \cdot 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2 \cdot 5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(3 \cdot 5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(7 \cdot 11\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(7 \cdot 13\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(11 \cdot 13\)</span>, no three have a common prime factor, but two out of every three are included in the first or second triple and therefore are not relatively prime.</p>
<p>This is clearly seen in the diagram – see Figure 54. Each vertex of the triangle has one of the numbers, and each side has a common factor of the numbers at its ends.</p>
<p>∇ If you add one more word to the condition of the problem, the statement will become true: from any six natural numbers, you can choose either three pairwise relatively prime numbers, or three numbers that pairwise have a common divisor greater than one.</p>

<p>For connoisseurs, this problem will undoubtedly remind you of this: among six people, you can always choose three pairwise acquaintances or three pairwise strangers.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 5-5.</strong> a) Answer: true.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> be the largest and smallest of the written numbers. If there is a number between them, then the statement is true. If they are next to each other, then there are two more numbers either to the right or to the left of them. They form the desired triple of numbers either with the number <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or with the number <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>For connoisseurs. There is a general theorem on this subject: in a partially ordered set consisting of <span class="math inline">\(mn + 1\)</span> elements, there will always be either a chain of length <span class="math inline">\(m + 1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span> pairwise incomparable elements (this theorem is a consequence of the well-known Dilworth’s theorem: in a partially ordered set, the minimum number of chains containing all elements of the set is equal to the maximum number of pairwise incomparable elements).</p>
<p>When considering five numbers, they can be ordered like this. We will assume that for the numbers <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, the relation <span class="math inline">\(a \prec b\)</span> holds if <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is less than <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and the number <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is to the left of the number <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in the written row. The numbers <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> turn out to be incomparable in this sense if and only if they are in decreasing order in the written row.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(5 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(m = n = 2\)</span>), it follows from the formulated theorem that from five numbers, there will always be three that go either in increasing order (chain of length <span class="math inline">\(m + 1 = 3\)</span>) or in decreasing order (<span class="math inline">\(n + 1 = 3\)</span> pairwise incomparable elements).

<p>Let’s give a counterexample – nine numbers: 3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 7.</p>

<p>If any two digits out of these nine are in decreasing order (the one that is smaller is further from the beginning of the sequence), then they are necessarily from the same triple.

<p>For connoisseurs. This idea – adding many negative numbers to positive numbers, but smaller in magnitude – helps to answer the following question: can the series <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\)</span> converge, and the series of cubes <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n^3\)</span> diverge? The answer to this question is positive. Here’s an example:</p>
<p>The series</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\left(1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \right) + ... + \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{6} \right) + ...\)</span> (*)</p>
<p>is constructed as follows: after the sum <span class="math inline">\(\left(1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right)\)</span>, we put <span class="math inline">\(2^3 = 8\)</span> sums <span class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \right)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(3^3 = 27\)</span> sums <span class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{6} - \frac{1}{6} \right)\)</span>, …, then <span class="math inline">\(n^3\)</span> sums <span class="math inline">\(\left(\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{2n} - \frac{1}{2n} \right)\)</span>, etc.</p>
<p>The specified series converges, since the sum of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of its first terms, where <span class="math inline">\(3^{1+2+3+...+n} &lt; N \le 3^{1+2+...+n+(n+1)}\)</span>, does not exceed the number <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2(n+1)}\)</span> (it is either equal to zero or equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2(n+1)}\)</span>).</p>
<p>The series of cubes of the terms of the series (*) diverges, since the sum of <span class="math inline">\(n^3\)</span> terms is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{4}\)</span>, therefore the sum of the first <span class="math inline">\(3(1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3)\)</span> terms is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3n^4}{4}\)</span> and, therefore, grows indefinitely.</p>
<p>It can be proved that only for functions of the form <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = kx\)</span> in some neighborhood of zero, the convergence of the series <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n\)</span> implies the convergence of the series <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(a_n)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 5-7.</strong> a) Answer: true.</p>
<p>Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(y = F(x) = f\left(x + \frac{1}{5}\right) - f(x)\)</span>, defined and continuous on the segment <span class="math inline">\([0; \frac{4}{5}]\)</span>. We need to prove that there is a point <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> on this segment such that <span class="math inline">\(F(x_0) = 0\)</span>. By the definition of the function <span class="math inline">\(y = F(x)\)</span>, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F(0) = f\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) - f(0)\)</span>, (1) <span class="math inline">\(F\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) = f\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) - f\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)\)</span>, (2) <span class="math inline">\(F\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) = f\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) - f\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)\)</span>, (3) <span class="math inline">\(F\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) = f\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) - f\left(\frac{3}{5}\right)\)</span>, (4) <span class="math inline">\(F\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) = f(1) - f\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\)</span>. (5)</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(f(0) = f(1)\)</span>, by adding equalities (1)–(5) term by term, we get</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F(0) + F\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) + F\left(\frac{2}{5}\right) + F\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) + F\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) = 0\)</span>. (*)</p>
<p>Equality (*) is possible only in two cases: either all five terms in its left-hand side are equal to zero – then the problem is solved, or among these terms there are numbers of different signs. Let <span class="math inline">\(F(x_1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F(x_2)\)</span> be numbers of different signs, where <span class="math inline">\(0 \le x_1 &lt; x_2 \le \frac{4}{5}\)</span>. Then, due to the continuity of the function <span class="math inline">\(F(x)\)</span>, there is a number <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(x_1 &lt; x_0 &lt; x_2\)</span>) such that <span class="math inline">\(F(x_0) = 0\)</span>, which was required.</p>

<p>Figure 55 shows the required example. Let’s explain how it is constructed.</p>

<p>Let’s draw parallel inclined lines <span class="math inline">\(l_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(l_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(l_3\)</span> through points A, C, and B, and intersecting lines <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_2\)</span> through points D and E, such that <span class="math inline">\(m_1 \perp m_2\)</span>. Denoting by <span class="math inline">\(P_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(P_4\)</span> the points of intersection of the lines <span class="math inline">\(l_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(l_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(l_3\)</span> with the lines <span class="math inline">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m_2\)</span> closest to the abscissa axis, we obtain the broken line <span class="math inline">\(AP_1DP_2CP_3EP_4B\)</span>. Let’s show that this broken line serves as the desired example.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is the graph of a continuous function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> on the segment [0; 1], and <span class="math inline">\(f(0) = f(1) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Secondly, it does not have a chord of length 2/5 parallel to the abscissa axis. Indeed, if the ends of the chord parallel to the Ox axis lie on adjacent links of the broken line, then it obviously does not exceed the segment DE, which is equal to 1/3. If the ends of the chord lie on links “through one” or “through two”, then it is not less than the segment AC, which is equal to 1/2. Since <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3} &lt; \frac{2}{5} &lt; \frac{1}{2}\)</span>, our statement is proved.</p>
<p>∇ Similar to the solution of problem 5-7 a), it can be proved that for the graph of the function <span class="math inline">\(y = f(x)\)</span> given in its condition, there exists a chord of length <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span>, parallel to the abscissa axis (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is any natural number) – see [62].</p>
<p>For connoisseurs. The last statement is a special case of Levy’s theorem: if a plane continuum has a chord of length <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, then it has a chord of length <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n} \cdot a\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is an arbitrary natural number) and a chord of length <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> parallel to it (where <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, for any number <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1\)</span>) that is not representable in the form <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a natural number), it is possible, similarly to the solution of problem 5-7 b), to construct an example of a plane continuum that has a chord of length 1 and does not have a parallel chord of length <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> – see [99].</p>
<p>Note also that for a periodic continuous function on a straight line, the situation is completely different: its graph will have a horizontal chord of any given length.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 5-8.</strong> Answer: it can.</p>
<p>Let’s give an example. As the first one, we take an equilateral triangle with a side length of 1/2 cm, and as the second one – an isosceles triangle with a base of 200 m and a height of <span class="math inline">\(10^{-7}\)</span> m. Its lateral side is greater than half the base, i.e., greater than 100 m, and its area is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{10^{-5}}{2}\)</span> m<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> and thus less than the area of the first triangle, which is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{16}\)</span> cm<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 5-9.</strong> a) Answer: it can.</p>
<p>Let’s give an example. Consider an isosceles triangle with a base of 800 cm and a height of 0.3 cm. Its area is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{800 \cdot 0.3}{2} = 120\)</span> cm<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> and thus greater than 100 cm<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>. Let’s show that this triangle satisfies the condition. Indeed, its height AH, dropped on the lateral side BC (Fig. 56), is equal to twice the length of the perpendicular DK, dropped from the midpoint of the base D to the lateral side BC, and this perpendicular, in turn, is less than the inclined line BD. From this it follows that the height AH is less than 0.6 cm and, therefore, all the heights of the triangle ABC are less than 1 cm.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 5-10.</strong> Answer: false.</p>
<p>The counterexample is shown in Figure 57. We took three vertices A, B, and D of the quadrilateral ABCD very close to each other, and the fourth vertex C and the point O inside the quadrilateral – close to each other and far from A, B, and D.</p>

<p>For connoisseurs. Let’s pose a more general question. For what <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the sum of the distances from any point lying inside the quadrilateral to the vertices of the quadrilateral less than <span class="math inline">\(kP\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> – the perimeter of the quadrilateral)? Answer: for <span class="math inline">\(k \ge \frac{3}{2}\)</span>. Let’s explain why this is so.</p>
<p>For each quadrilateral ABCD, the point for which the sum of the distances to the vertices is maximum is one of its vertices.</p>
<p>Indeed, the function (on the plane) <span class="math inline">\(M \to AM\)</span>, where A is a fixed point of the plane, is convex (its graph is a cone), and the sum of four convex functions</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f(M) = AM + BM + CM + DM\)</span></p>
<p>is also convex. The largest value of a convex function on a polygon is reached at its vertex.</p>
<p>Let’s now show that this largest value is less than <span class="math inline">\(kP\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the perimeter of the quadrilateral). Answer: for <span class="math inline">\(k \ge \frac{3}{2}\)</span>. Let’s explain why this is so.</p>
<p>For each quadrilateral <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span>, the point for which the sum of the distances to the vertices is maximum is one of its vertices.</p>
<p>Indeed, the function (on the plane) <span class="math inline">\(M \to AM\)</span>, where A is a fixed point of the plane, is convex (its graph is a cone), and the sum of four convex functions</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f(M) = AM + BM + CM + DM\)</span></p>
<p>is also convex. The largest value of a convex function on a polygon is reached at its vertex.</p>
<p>Let’s now show that this largest value is less than <span class="math inline">\(\frac{3}{2}P\)</span>. Let it be achieved at vertex <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Adding the inequalities <span class="math inline">\(AC &lt; AB + BC\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(AC &lt; AD + DC\)</span> term by term, we get <span class="math inline">\(2|AC| &lt; P\)</span>, and even more so,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(2AC &lt; P + 2(BC + CD)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Adding the sum <span class="math inline">\(2AB + 2AD\)</span> to both sides of the last inequality, we obtain the required inequality</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(AB + AC + AD &lt; \frac{3}{2}P\)</span></p>
<p>(see [24]).</p>
<p>For any <span class="math inline">\(k &lt; \frac{3}{2}\)</span> it is possible to construct a counterexample by setting <span class="math inline">\(MA = MB = MD = CO = \epsilon\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is a sufficiently small number (see Figure 57).</p>
<p>Note also that to find the point inside a given convex quadrilateral with the smallest sum of distances to the vertices, you do not need to be a great expert: this is the point of intersection of its diagonals.</p>

<p>∇ It turns out that the following statement is true: a right-angled isosceles triangle can be cut into any number greater than 10 of pairwise unequal right-angled isosceles triangles.</p>
<p>First, let’s show how you can cut it into any even number of parts <span class="math inline">\(2k\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k \ge 3\)</span>. We will start from a right-angled isosceles triangle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> with a right angle <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Let’s extend its legs <span class="math inline">\(CA\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(CB\)</span> and draw a line <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> through the vertex <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> perpendicular to the hypotenuse – see Figure 59.</p>

<p>Let’s construct a broken line <span class="math inline">\(AB_1A_1B_2A_2B_3...B_kA_k\)</span>, all links <span class="math inline">\(B_iA_i\)</span> of which are parallel to the line <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>, and all links <span class="math inline">\(A_iB_{i+1}\)</span> are parallel to the line <span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span>; through the last link <span class="math inline">\(B_kA_k\)</span> of the broken line, we draw a line that will intersect the line <span class="math inline">\(BC\)</span> at some point <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. As a result, we will arrive, as is easy to show, at a right-angled isosceles triangle <span class="math inline">\(DCA\)</span>, divided in the required way into <span class="math inline">\(2k + 2\)</span> similar pairwise unequal right-angled isosceles triangles (a special case of this construction for <span class="math inline">\(k = 2\)</span> is used in the solution of problem 5-11). In the chain of triangles <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(BAB_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_1BA_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_1BB_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B_2AA_2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(A_{k-1}B_kA_k\)</span>, each subsequent triangle is similar to the previous one with a similarity coefficient of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> (the hypotenuse of the previous triangle is equal to the leg of the next one), therefore, in the sequence of segments <span class="math inline">\(CA\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(AA_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_1A_2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(A_{k-1}A_k\)</span>, each subsequent one is twice as long as the previous one. From this follows a practical way of cutting a given triangle in the required way.</p>
<p>Let it be required to divide a right-angled isosceles triangle with a leg <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(2k + 2\)</span> parts. Let’s set aside segments of length <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{2^{k-1}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2a}{2^{k-1}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4a}{2^{k-1}}\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2^{k-1}a}{2^{k-1}}\)</span> sequentially from the vertex of the right angle on the leg (since <span class="math inline">\(1 + 2 + ... + 2^{k-1} = 2^k - 1\)</span>, this can be done); the obtained points will be the vertices <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_3\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(A_k\)</span> of the broken line of the construction described above.</p>
<p>So, you can cut the triangle into <span class="math inline">\(2k\)</span> parts for <span class="math inline">\(k \ge 3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the smaller of the triangles obtained in this way can again be cut into 6 parts in the way indicated above, we can cut the original triangle into <span class="math inline">\(2k + 5l\)</span> parts, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is any integer greater than 3, and <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> is any natural number. In our construction, the ends of the rods form two equilateral triangles, located in planes perpendicular to the line connecting their centers and rotated by a certain angle relative to each other. The rods themselves lie on pairwise intersecting lines.</p>
<p>∇ The connection of rods and threads in Figure 60 is the same as that of an octahedron (it forms the graph of an octahedron – see Fig. 67 for problem 5-15). It is difficult to mathematically prove the existence of such a construction (sufficiency of the condition <span class="math inline">\(d = l \sqrt{1 + \frac{k^2}{3}}\)</span>).</p>

<p>This connection was invented in the 1960s by the architect B. Fuller. After him, many different designs of this type appeared. When writing this book, the authors set the following task: to make a rigid spatial structure from rods and threads so that the rods do not touch each other and exactly two threads depart from each end of the rods. Such a connection was made by the architect V. Koleichuk. The connection diagram is shown in Figure 61.</p>

<p>Architect, engineer, and designer Richard Buckminster Fuller gained the most fame thanks to his constructions called “geodesic dome”. He introduced the term “tensegrity” associated with them.</p>
<p>However, the architect Vyacheslav Koleichuk, who dealt a lot with such systems in the 90s of the last century, questioned the priority of B. Fuller. He argued that such systems were first invented by our domestic constructivist Karl Ioganson in 1921. A large number of modern studies are devoted to these systems with applications in interactive and adaptive structures.</p>
<p>In architecture, the term “tensegrity” was defined by B. Fuller as “the property of frame structures, in which whole parts loaded in tension and composite parts loaded in compression are involved, to work in such a way that each part functions with maximum efficiency and economy”.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the writer and anthropologist Carlos Castaneda (with the personal permission of B. Fuller!) used the term “tensegrity” to refer to a system of breathing, movements, and body positions developed by Indian shamans who lived in ancient Mexico, aimed at forming certain properties and qualities of a person engaged in this system. Thus, tensegrity according to Castaneda is a modernized version of some movements and breathing called “magical passes”.</p>
<p>The concept of “tensegrity” is also used in the study of processes in biology (especially in cell biology) and in some other industries, for example, in studies of the structure of textile fabrics, design, research of social structures, ensemble music and geodesy.</p>
<p>We especially note the application of the mathematical basis of this concept in chemistry. At the end of the 20th century, there was a great interest in fullerenes (of course, named after B. Fuller) or buckyballs. This is the name of molecular compounds belonging to the class of allotropic forms of carbon (Allotropy – the property of the existence of the same type of chemical element in the form of two or more simple substances that differ in structure and properties. For example, graphite and diamond are allotropic forms of carbon; other forms are diamond, carbyne and graphite) and representing convex closed polyhedra composed of an even number (three-coordinated) carbon atoms (this is the principle according to which the geodesic constructions of B. Fuller are built). At first, only structures were considered, including only pentagonal and hexagonal faces. According to Euler’s theorem for polyhedra, if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> are the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a polyhedron, respectively, then <span class="math inline">\(n - e + f = 2\)</span>. Using this theorem, it can be proved that a necessary condition for the existence of the polyhedron indicated above is the presence of exactly 12 pentagonal faces and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n}{2} - 10\)</span> hexagonal faces. In addition to carbon atoms, atoms of other chemical elements can also be included in the composition of fullerene molecules.</p>
<p>The possibility of the existence of fullerenes was predicted in 1971 in Japan, and theoretically substantiated in 1973 in the USSR. For the discovery of fullerenes, H. Kroto, R. Smalley and R.

<p>Consider a cube <span class="math inline">\(ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1\)</span> with edge <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> (Fig. 62, a) and a spatial hexagon <span class="math inline">\(AA_1B_1C_1CD_1\)</span> (its vertices do not lie in the same plane). It turns out that through this hexagon (and hence through the cube) it is possible to freely stretch a cube with edge <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> without touching its sides.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>To verify this, let’s depict in Figure 62, b the projection of the cube onto a plane perpendicular to its diagonal <span class="math inline">\(BD_1\)</span>. Due to the symmetry of the cube, this projection is a regular hexagon <span class="math inline">\(A'A_1'B'C'C_1'D'\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A'\)</span> is the projection of the point <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_1'\)</span> is the projection of the point <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, etc. Thus, the contour of the hexagon <span class="math inline">\(A'A_1'B'C'C_1'D'\)</span> is the projection of the spatial hexagon <span class="math inline">\(AAB_1C_1CD_1\)</span>, and both ends of the diagonal of the cube <span class="math inline">\(BD_1\)</span> are projected to the center <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> of the regular hexagon.</p>
<p>Since the sine of the angle between any edge of the cube and its diagonal is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\)</span>, the side of the regular hexagon is equal to <span class="math inline">\(a\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\)</span>, and the radius of the circle inscribed in it is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}\)</span> – half the diagonal of the square with side <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Therefore, a square with a center at point <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> and a side <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> will fit entirely in the hexagon without touching its sides, as shown in Figure 62, b.</p>
<p>From this it follows that if you put a cube with edge <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> so that its lower face coincides with the square in Figure 62, b, and move the cube perpendicular to the plane of the hexagon, then the cube will not touch the sides of the hexagon. This means that it can also be stretched through a spatial hexagon along the diagonal <span class="math inline">\(BD_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, a through hole can be made in a wooden cube through which the same cube can be stretched – see Figure 63.</p>

</div>
<p>∇ From the above reasoning, it follows that through a cube with edge <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> it is possible to stretch even a cube of slightly larger dimensions than itself, namely any cube with an edge less than <span class="math inline">\((\sqrt{3} - 1)a\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 5-14.</strong> Answer: it exists.</p>
<p>Figure 64 shows an example of such a polyhedron. It is obtained as follows: on the edge <span class="math inline">\(BD\)</span> of the tetrahedron <span class="math inline">\(ABCD\)</span>, a “notch” of two triangular faces – <span class="math inline">\(GEH\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(GFH\)</span> – is made. It has 8 vertices, 6 faces, 12 edges.</p>

<p>∇ This problem resembles the well-known problem “about houses and wells”: is it possible to draw nine non-intersecting roads on a plane that connect each of the three “houses” with each of the three “wells”? In this network of roads (as well as in problem 5-15) there are 6 vertices and 3 segments depart from each vertex (Fig. 66). However, the answer to the question “about houses and wells” is negative: such a network cannot be drawn. The reason for this fact is Euler’s theorem: let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be the number of vertices, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> be the number of segments connecting some of these vertices, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be the number of polygons into which the plane is divided by these segments; then <span class="math inline">\(n + f = m + 1\)</span> (see [92]).</p>

<p>For connoisseurs. There is a theorem (Wagner, Fáry, Stein): if a graph can be depicted on a plane without intersections, then it can be depicted on a plane so that all its edges are segments. A necessary and sufficient condition for the planarity of a graph is the Pontryagin–Kuratowski theorem: a graph can be depicted on a plane without intersections if and only if it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to a graph with six vertices of the “houses – wells” type or a complete graph with five vertices (five points, pairwise connected by edges) (see [92]).</p>

<li>Answer: it does not exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose that we managed to construct such a broken line. Let’s consider any point of its self-intersection. Two links intersect at it, and they do not intersect with any other links. Therefore, all links of the broken line can be divided into pairs corresponding to the points of its self-intersection. This means that there is an even number of links and there cannot be seven.</p>
<p>∇ This reasoning shows that in general there is no broken line with an odd number of links that intersects each of its links exactly once.</p>

<li>Suppose that 25 coins are laid out on the plane in the required way, and we arrive at a contradiction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mark on the edge of each coin the three places where it touches the three others. Let’s count the total number of marked places in two ways. On the one hand, the number of marked places is even, since these places are divided into pairs at the points of contact of the coins. On the other hand, the number of marked places is odd, since it is equal to the number of coins 25 multiplied by 3.</p>
<p>The resulting contradiction proves our statement.</p>
<p>∇ It is interesting to find out for which <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> it is impossible to arrange a certain (finite) number of identical round coins on a plane so that each touches <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of the others. It turns out that this cannot be done for <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; 3\)</span>. Let’s prove it.</p>
<p>Suppose that identical round coins are laid out on a plane so that each of them touches <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> others. Mark the centers of all coins on the plane and consider their convex hull – the smallest convex polygon containing them. Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> be three consecutive vertices of it; then the angle <span class="math inline">\(ABC\)</span> is less than 180°. Let the coin centered at point <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> touch the coins centered at <span class="math inline">\(O_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(O_2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(O_k\)</span> (the centers are numbered in the order of traversal around point <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in one of the two possible directions). It is easily shown that each of the angles <span class="math inline">\(O_1BO_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(O_2BO_3\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(O_{k-1}BO_k\)</span> is not less than 60°. From this it follows that the inequality <span class="math inline">\(k \cdot 60° \le 180°\)</span> must be satisfied, which implies that <span class="math inline">\(k \le 3\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s now show how, for <span class="math inline">\(k = 3\)</span>, it is possible to decompose any sufficiently large even number of coins in the required way. For this, it is convenient to use blanks of two types: a “rhombus” of four coins and a “flashlight” of six coins.</p>
<p>It is easy to assemble a chain of 16 coins from four “rhombuses”. Figure 71, b shows how these “rhombuses” and “flashlights” can be folded into a closed chain containing 18 coins. Any larger even number can be represented as a sum of <span class="math inline">\(4n + 6m\)</span> and assemble the corresponding chain from <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> “rhombuses” and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> “flashlights”.</p>
<p>Similar questions about the arrangement of balls in space are interesting. In 1953, it was proved that no more than 12 identical balls can be attached to a ball in space [116].</p>
<p><strong>Problem 5-18.</strong> Answer: it can.</p>
<p>Let’s assign a point to each person, and different points to different people. If two people know each other, then we connect the corresponding points with a segment. Then the problem will be reduced to the following: is there a diagram that does not have triangles, and any two points are either connected by a segment or are opposite vertices of exactly one quadrilateral?</p>
<p>Figure 72, a, b shows two simplest examples of such schemes. We need to give an example of a scheme consisting of more than four points. Figure 72, c shows an example of a scheme of 16 points and 40 segments that satisfies the condition. The resulting scheme satisfies the condition of the problem. This can be verified by enumeration, which is simplified due to the symmetry of the scheme.</p>

<p>∇ It is interesting that the configuration described in the solution of problem 5-18 can be described as a set of vertices, edges, and large diagonals of a four-dimensional cube.</p>
<p>It can be shown that under the conditions of problem 5-18, each person in a given company has the same number of acquaintances. Indeed, let for each person <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M_A\)</span> denote the set of his acquaintances, and <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span> denote the set of people unfamiliar with <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Then each element from <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span> can be associated with a pair of elements from <span class="math inline">\(M_A\)</span> (those with whom he is familiar). It is not difficult to prove that the correspondence between the set <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span> and the set of all possible pairs of elements of <span class="math inline">\(M_A\)</span> will be one-to-one. Therefore, if <span class="math inline">\(M_A\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(m_A\)</span> elements, then <span class="math inline">\(N_A\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}m_A(m_A - 1)\)</span> elements, and in total, the company will have <span class="math inline">\(n = 1 + m_A + \frac{1}{2}m_A(m_A - 1)\)</span> people. This equality holds for any person <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>But the equation <span class="math inline">\(1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x(x-1) = n\)</span> has (for <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 1\)</span>) only one positive root, so the number <span class="math inline">\(m_A\)</span> is the same for all <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (see [10]).</p>
<p>We do not know the complete answer to the question of for which values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such companies exist. As shown above, <span class="math inline">\(n = 1 + \frac{m(m+1)}{2}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the number of acquaintances of one person. It is not difficult to prove that such companies do not exist for <span class="math inline">\(m = 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(m = 4\)</span>, and for <span class="math inline">\(m = 4k + 3\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is any natural number.

<p>∇ When <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> different symbols are written in an <span class="math inline">\(n \times n\)</span> table so that all different symbols are in each row and each column, it is said that a Latin square is given. Two Latin squares <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are called orthogonal if in those cells where the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th symbol is in square <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, all symbols are different in square <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (and so for each (<span class="math inline">\(i = 1, 2, ..., n\)</span>).</p>
<p>Our task was to construct three pairwise orthogonal Latin squares <span class="math inline">\(4 \times 4\)</span> (one gives the color, the second – the shape of the frame, and the third – the letter).</p>
<p>For connoisseurs. To compile similar square tables (they are useful in applied problems, for example, in planning multi-purpose experiments), it is convenient to use the concept of a finite affine plane (see [42]).</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be a finite field of <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> elements; pairs <span class="math inline">\((x; y)\)</span> of elements of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> will be called points of the finite affine plane, and sets of the form <span class="math inline">\(\{(x;y): ax + by + c = 0\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c \in F\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is not equal to zero, are called lines.</p>
<p>In total, there are <span class="math inline">\(q^2\)</span> points and <span class="math inline">\(q(q + 1)\)</span> lines, and they are divided into <span class="math inline">\(q + 1\)</span> families so that in each family there are exactly <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> lines “parallel” to each other, and <span class="math inline">\(q + 1\)</span> lines pass through each point.</p>
<p>For example, one family is the lines <span class="math inline">\(x + c = 0\)</span>, another is <span class="math inline">\(y + c = 0\)</span>, the third is <span class="math inline">\(x + y + c = 0\)</span>, the fourth (if <span class="math inline">\(q &gt; 2\)</span>) is <span class="math inline">\(x + 2y + c = 0\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>Let’s assign a certain property to each of the <span class="math inline">\(q + 1\)</span> families: “column number”, “row number”, “letter”, “frame shape”, etc. Let’s assign a certain row number to the points of each of the <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> lines of the first family, a certain column number to the points of each of the lines of the second family, a letter to the third, a frame shape to the fourth, and so on. Then we will get a way to find out in which cell of the table <span class="math inline">\(q \times q\)</span> to place each point <span class="math inline">\((x; y)\)</span>, what color to assign to it, what letter, etc. Any two non-parallel lines intersect at one point, so that for any two given properties there is exactly one cell with the desired pair of properties.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(q = 4\)</span>, there is a finite field of elements 0, 1, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, leading precisely to the solution of our problem. The addition and multiplication tables in this field are given below.</p>

<p>It can be shown that there are no more than <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> pairwise orthogonal Latin squares of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Moreover, the existence of <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> such squares is equivalent to the existence of a projective plane of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (see the solution of the next problem 5-21 about the projective plane). If <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a prime number or a power of a prime number, then a projective plane of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> exists. For other <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the existence of a projective plane of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is an unsolved problem.</p>
<p>In 1782, Leonhard Euler proposed the following problem.</p>
<p>Is it possible to arrange 36 officers of six different ranks, taken from six different regiments, in the form of a <span class="math inline">\(6 \times 6\)</span> square so that each row and each column contains officers of each rank and from each regiment?</p>
<p>In other words, L. Euler asked if there are two orthogonal Latin squares of order 6.</p>
<p>It can be shown that if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> does not give a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then two orthogonal squares of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> exist. L. Euler suggested that if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then there are no such squares.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(n = 2\)</span>, Euler’s hypothesis is easy to verify, so <span class="math inline">\(n = 6\)</span> is the first difficult case. In 1900, Tarry verified the indicated hypothesis in this case, listing all Latin squares of order 6. The book [133] provides a proof of Euler’s hypothesis for <span class="math inline">\(n = 6\)</span>, and it is not based on complete enumeration.</p>
<p>It turned out that for <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 6\)</span>, Euler’s hypothesis is incorrect. In 1959, Parker found two orthogonal Latin squares of order 10, and a year later his construction was generalized, and a pair of Latin squares of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> was constructed for all <span class="math inline">\(n \equiv 2 (\text{mod } 4)\)</span>, except, of course, <span class="math inline">\(n = 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n = 6\)</span>.</p>
<p>Almost nothing is known about three pairwise orthogonal Latin squares. The first unresolved case is <span class="math inline">\(n = 10\)</span>.</p>

<p>It follows from the condition that the members of the club go to the cafe either in pairs or in threes.</p>

<p>Can it be that <span class="math inline">\(m &lt; n\)</span>? When is equality <span class="math inline">\(m = n\)</span> possible? (See [84], ch.&nbsp;III, § 5, exercise. 12.)</p>
<p>For connoisseurs. Let’s prove that always <span class="math inline">\(m \ge n\)</span>. Let’s number all the selected subsets: <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(A_m\)</span> and the elements of the set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_3\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span>.</p>
<p>We assign an <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>-dimensional vector <span class="math inline">\(a_i = (\lambda_{i1}, \lambda_{i2}, ..., \lambda_{im})\)</span> to each element <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> in the following way: <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{ij} = 0\)</span> if the element <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> is not included in the set <span class="math inline">\(A_j\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{ij} = 1\)</span> if this element is included in <span class="math inline">\(A_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>It follows from the condition that the scalar product of any two such vectors is equal to 1, i.e., <span class="math inline">\((a_i, a_j) = 1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i \ne j\)</span>, and the scalar square of the vector is not less than 2 (since each element is included in at least 2 sets).</p>
<p>Now suppose that <span class="math inline">\(m &lt; n\)</span>. Since the number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of vectors <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> is greater than the dimension of the space <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the system of vectors <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span> is linearly dependent, i.e., the equation <span class="math inline">\(x_1 a_1 + x_2 a_2 + ... + x_n a_n = 0\)</span> has a non-zero solution. Sequentially multiplying both sides of this equation scalarly by the vectors <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span>, we obtain a system of linear equations of the form</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(b_1 x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n = 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + b_2 x_2 + ... + x_n = 0\)</span>, … <span class="math inline">\(x_1 + x_2 + ... + b_n x_n = 0\)</span>,</p>
<p>where all <span class="math inline">\(b_i \ge 2\)</span>. But this system has only a zero solution (its determinant is different from zero), which contradicts our assumption. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(m \ge n\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the equality <span class="math inline">\(m = n\)</span> to hold, it is necessary and sufficient that one of the following two cases takes place:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>all elements of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, except for one, are included in one of the selected subsets, and the remaining selected subsets consist of pairs formed by this remaining element and all the others;</p></li>
<li><p>the number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is represented as <span class="math inline">\(l(l-1) + 1\)</span>, each selected subset consists of <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> elements, and each element of the set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> belongs to exactly <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> subsets.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the question of when case 2) is realized is not solved. The system of subsets of the set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> from the generalization ∇, satisfying condition 2), has a special name: a finite projective plane of order <span class="math inline">\(q = l - 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s show how to construct a finite projective plane of order <span class="math inline">\(q = p^k\)</span> (for <span class="math inline">\(n = p^{2k} + p^k + 1\)</span>), where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a prime number. To do this, you need to use “numbers” from a finite field of order <span class="math inline">\(p^k\)</span>.</p>
<p>We call a triple of “numbers” <span class="math inline">\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\)</span>, considered up to proportionality (i.e., the triples <span class="math inline">\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((cx_1, cx_2, cx_3)\)</span> define the same point), a point of our plane. We agree not to consider the triple <span class="math inline">\((0; 0; 0)\)</span> as a point. A line is given by a triple of “numbers” <span class="math inline">\((a_1, a_2, a_3)\)</span> (except for the triple <span class="math inline">\((0; 0; 0)\)</span>), considered up to proportionality. The point <span class="math inline">\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\)</span> belongs to the line <span class="math inline">\((a_1, a_2, a_3)\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is clear that the constructed projective plane implements case 2). In this case, the points of the plane are the elements of the set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, the lines are the selected subsets. The number of points and the number of lines are the same, and any two points belong to only one line.</p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(q = 2\)</span>, we get exactly the same example of a projective plane of order 2, which is shown in Figure 76, b.</p>
<p>In paragraph b) of problem 5-21, the required system of sets was constructed for the case <span class="math inline">\(l = 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n = 7\)</span>.</p>
<p>More details about finite projective planes are written, for example, in the article [132].</p>
<p>Problem 5–21 can be reformulated in the following equivalent form.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> subsets are selected in a set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> elements, any two of which have exactly one common element, then <span class="math inline">\(m \ge n\)</span>. (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the set of visits to the cafe; for each member of the club <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, we select the set of all visits that included <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.)</p>
<p>This formulation allows a natural generalization.</p>
<p>Given a natural number <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and a set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> elements, in which <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> subsets are selected, any two of which have exactly <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> common elements. Then <span class="math inline">\(m \ge n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Proof. Let <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> be the set of all selected subsets of the set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(|A| = \lambda\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(A \in Y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> must be a subset of any <span class="math inline">\(B \in Y\)</span>. If we remove <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and from each <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, we get a partition of the set <span class="math inline">\(X \setminus A\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> pairwise disjoint subsets. The number of such subsets is maximum if one of them is empty, and all the others are single-element. Since <span class="math inline">\(|X \setminus A| = m - \lambda\)</span>, we get that</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(n \le m - \lambda + 1 \le m\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(|A| &gt; \lambda\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(A \in Y\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(X = \{1, 2, ..., m\}\)</span>. Consider all possible linear polynomials</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f(z_1, z_2, ..., z_m) = a_0 + a_1 z_1 + a_2 z_2 + ... + a_m z_m\)</span></p>
<p>with real coefficients <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span>, …, <span class="math inline">\(a_m\)</span>. They form a vector space of dimension <span class="math inline">\(m + 1\)</span>. For each subset <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of the set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, we introduce <span class="math inline">\(f(P) = f(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_m)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i = 1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(i \in P\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_i = 0\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(i \notin P\)</span>. For example, <span class="math inline">\(f(\emptyset) = a_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(X) = a_0 + a_1 + ... + a_m\)</span>.</p>
<p>For each <span class="math inline">\(A \in Y\)</span>, consider the polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f_A = -\lambda + \sum_{i \in A} z_i\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f_A(P) = -\lambda + |A \cap P|\)</span> for any subset <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of the set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Therefore, if <span class="math inline">\(A, B \in Y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f_A(B) = 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(A \ne B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_A(A) = |A| - \lambda &gt; 0\)</span>. This implies that the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> polynomials <span class="math inline">\(f_A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A \in Y\)</span>, are linearly independent.</p>
<p>Indeed, if <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{A \in Y} \alpha_A f_A = 0\)</span> for some real coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_A\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{A \in Y} \alpha_A f_A (B) = 0\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(B \in Y\)</span> and, therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_B = 0\)</span>. Moreover, no linear combination of polynomials <span class="math inline">\(f_A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A \in Y\)</span>, is equal to 1.</p>
<p>Indeed, if <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{A \in Y} \alpha_A f_A = 1\)</span> for some real coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_A\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{A \in Y} \alpha_A f_A (B) = 1\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(B \in Y\)</span> and, therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{A \in Y} \frac{\alpha_B}{B - \lambda} = 1\)</span>, which is impossible, since the constant term of each polynomial <span class="math inline">\(f_A\)</span> is negative, and therefore the constant term of the left-hand side of the last equality must be negative.</p>
<p>So, the polynomials <span class="math inline">\(f_A\)</span> and the constant polynomial 1 are linearly independent. Therefore,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(n + 1 \le m + 1 \Rightarrow n \le m\)</span>.</p>
<p>What happens if <span class="math inline">\(m = n\)</span>?</p>
<p>If all sets <span class="math inline">\(A \in Y\)</span> consist of the same number of elements, then the corresponding structure is called a symmetric <span class="math inline">\((m, k, \lambda)\)</span>-design.</p>
<p>A projective plane of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a symmetric <span class="math inline">\((n^2 + n + 1, n + 1, 1)\)</span>-design.</p>
<p>Example. Let’s number the vertices of the graph shown in Figure 72, c, with the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, 16. If <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is any of these numbers, then let <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> be the set consisting of the vertex <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and its five neighbors. Then <span class="math inline">\(|A_i \cap A_j| = 2\)</span> for any two different <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, so that we get a symmetric <span class="math inline">\((16, 6, 2)\)</span>-design.</p>
<p>If not all sets <span class="math inline">\(A \in Y\)</span> consist of the same number of elements, then, according to the Ryser–Woodall conjecture, all sets <span class="math inline">\(A \in Y\)</span>, except for one, consist of the same number of elements. By 2011, this conjecture has been proven for <span class="math inline">\(m = p + 1\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(m = 2p + 1\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(m = 3p + 1\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(m = 4p + 1\)</span>; <span class="math inline">\(m = 6p + 1\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a prime number, and also for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda &lt; 60\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<p>You can learn about the current state of the theory of symmetric designs and the Ryser–Woodall conjecture from the monograph [133], which was mentioned in the solution of the previous problem 5-20.</p>
